</div>

<p>To the memory of those truly cultured and unselfish
men, the poet-scribes and hedge-schoolmasters of the
last century and the beginning of this—men who may
well be called the last of the Milesians—I dedicate this
effort to preserve even a scrap of that native lore which
in their day they loved so passionately, and for the
preservation of which they worked so nobly, but in vain.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/deco3.jpg" width="125" height="15" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Irish and Scotch Gaelic folk-stories are, as a living
form of literature, by this time pretty nearly a thing
of the past. They have been trampled in the common
ruin under the feet of the Zeitgeist, happily not before a
large harvest has been reaped in Scotland, but, unfortunately,
before anything worth mentioning has been
done in Ireland to gather in the crop which grew luxuriantly
a few years ago. Until quite recently there
existed in our midst millions of men and women who,
when their day’s work was over, sought and found
mental recreation in a domain to which few indeed of
us who read books are permitted to enter. Man, all the
world over, when he is tired of the actualities of life,
seeks to unbend his mind with the creations of fancy.
We who can read betake ourselves to our favourite
novelist, and as we peruse his fictions, we can almost
see our author erasing this, heightening that, and laying
on such-and-such a touch for effect. His book is the
product of his individual brain, and some of us or of our
contemporaries have been present at its genesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>But no one can tell us with certainty of the genesis
of the folk-tale, no one has been consciously present at
its inception, and no one has marked its growth. It is
in many ways a mystery, part of the flotsam and jetsam
of the ages, still beating feebly against the shore of the
nineteenth century, swallowed up at last in England by
the waves of materialism and civilization combined; but
still surviving unengulfed on the western coasts of Ireland,
where I gathered together some bundles of it, of
which the present volume is one.</p>

<p>The folk-lore of Ireland, like its folk-songs and native
literature, remains practically unexploited and ungathered.
Attempts have been made from time to time during
the present century to collect Irish folk-lore, but these
attempts, though interesting from a literary point of
view, are not always successes from a scientific one.
Crofton Croker’s delightful book, “Fairy Legends and
Traditions of the South of Ireland,” first published
anonymously in 1825, led the way. All the other books
which have been published on the subject have but followed
in the footsteps of his; but all have not had the
merit of his light style, his pleasant parallels from classic
and foreign literature, and his delightful annotations,
which touch, after a fascinating manner peculiarly his
own, upon all that is of interest in his text. I have
written the word “text,” but that word conveys the idea
of an original to be annotated upon; and Crofton Croker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
is, alas! too often his own original. There lies his weak
point, and there, too, is the defect of all who have followed
him. The form in which the stories are told is,
of course, Croker’s own; but no one who knows anything
of fairy lore will suppose, that his manipulation of
the originals is confined to the form merely. The fact
is that he learned the ground-work of his tales from conversations
with the Southern peasantry, whom he knew
well, and then elaborated this over the midnight oil
with great skill and delicacy of touch, in order to give a
saleable book, thus spiced, to the English public.</p>

<p>Setting aside the novelists Carleton and Lover, who
only published some incidental and largely-manipulated
Irish stories, the next person to collect Irish folk-lore in
a volume was Patrick Kennedy, a native of the County
Wexford, who published “Legendary Fictions of the
Irish Celts,” and in 1870 a good book, entitled, “The
Fireside Stories of Ireland,” which he had himself heard
in Wexford when a boy. Many of the stories which he
gives appear to be the detritus of genuine Gaelic folk-stories,
filtered through an English idiom and much impaired
and stunted in the process. He appears, however,
not to have adulterated them very much. Two of
the best stories in the book, “Jack, the Cunning Thief,”
and “Shawn an Omadawn,” I heard myself in the adjoining
county Wicklow, and the versions of them that
I heard did not differ very widely from Kennedy’s. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
is interesting to note that these counties, close to the
Pale as they are, and under English influence for so
long, nevertheless seem to have preserved a considerable
share of the old Gaelic folk-tales in English dress,
while in Leitrim, Longford, Meath, and those counties
where Irish died out only a generation or two ago, there
has been made as clean a sweep of folk-lore and Gaelic
traditions as the most uncompromising “West Briton”
could desire. The reason why some of the folk-stories survive
in the eastern counties is probably because the Irish
language was there exchanged for English at a time
when, for want of education and printed books, folk-stories
(the only mental recreation of the people) <i>had</i> to
transfer themselves rightly or wrongly into English.
When this first took place I cannot tell, but I have heard
from old people in Waterford, that when some of their
fathers or grandfathers marched north to join the Wexford
Irish in ’98, they were astonished to find English
nearly universally used amongst them. Kennedy says
of his stories: “I have endeavoured to present them in
a form suitable for the perusal of both sexes and of all
ages”; and “such as they are, they may be received by
our readers as obtained from local sources.” Unfortunately,
the sources are not given by him any more than
by Croker, and we cannot be sure how much belongs to
Kennedy the bookseller, and how much to the Wexford
peasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>After this come Lady Wilde’s volumes;—her “Ancient
Legends,” and her recently published “Ancient Cures,
Charms, and Usages,” in both of which books she gives
us a large amount of narrative matter in a folk-lore dress;
but, like her predecessors, she disdains to quote an authority,
and scorns to give us the least inkling as to where
such-and-such a legend, or cure, or superstition comes
from, from whom it was obtained, who were her informants,
whether peasant or other, in what parishes or
counties the superstition or legend obtains, and all the
other collateral information which the modern folk-lorist
is sure to expect. Her entire ignorance of Irish, through
the medium of which alone such tales and superstitions
can properly, if at all, be collected, is apparent every
time she introduces an Irish word. She astonishes us
Irish speakers with such striking observations as this—“Peasants
in Ireland wishing you good luck, say in
Irish, ‘The blessing of Bel and the blessing of Samhain
be with you,’ that is, of the sun and of the moon.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
would be interesting to know the locality where so curious
a Pagan custom is still practised, for I confess that
though I have spoken Irish in every county where it is
still spoken, I have never been, nor do I expect to be,
so saluted. Lady Wilde’s volumes, are, nevertheless, a
wonderful and copious record of folk-lore and folk customs,
which must lay Irishmen under one more debt of
gratitude to the gifted compiler. It is unfortunate, however,
that these volumes are hardly as valuable as they
are interesting, and for the usual reason—that we do not
know what is Lady Wilde’s and what is not.</p>

<p>Almost contemporaneously with Lady Wilde’s last
book there appeared this year yet another important
work, a collection of Irish folk-tales taken from the
Gaelic speakers of the south and north-west, by an
American gentleman, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin. He has
collected some twenty tales, which are told very well,
and with much less cooking and flavouring than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
predecessors employed. Mr. Curtin tells us that he has
taken his tales from the old Gaelic-speaking men; but
he must have done so through the awkward medium
of an interpreter, for his ignorance of the commonest
Irish words is as startling as Lady Wilde’s.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He follows
Lady Wilde in this, too, that he keeps us in profound
ignorance of his authorities. He mentions not one
name, and except that he speaks in a general way of
old Gaelic speakers in nooks where the language is still
spoken, he leaves us in complete darkness as to where
and from whom, and how he collected these stories. In
this he does not do himself justice, for, from my own
knowledge of Irish folk-lore, such as it is, I can easily
recognize that Mr. Curtin has approached the fountain-head
more nearly than any other. Unfortunately, like
his predecessors, he has a literary style of his own, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
which, to say the least of it, there is no counterpart in
the Gaelic from which he has translated.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>We have as yet had no folk-lorist in Ireland who
could compare for a moment with such a man as Iain
Campbell, of Islay, in investigative powers, thoroughness
of treatment, and acquaintance with the people,
combined with a powerful national sentiment, and, above
all, a knowledge of Gaelic. It is on this last rock that
all our workers-up of Irish folk-lore split. In most
circles in Ireland it is a disgrace to be known to talk
Irish; and in the capital, if one makes use of an Irish
word to express one’s meaning, as one sometimes does
of a French or German word, one would be looked upon
as positively outside the pale of decency; hence we
need not be surprised at the ignorance of Gaelic Ireland
displayed by littérateurs who write for the English
public, and foist upon us modes of speech which we
have not got, and idioms which they never learned
from us.</p>

<p>This being the case, the chief interest in too many of
our folk-tale writers lies in their individual treatment
of the skeletons of the various Gaelic stories obtained
through English mediums, and it is not devoid of interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
to watch the various garbs in which the sophisticated
minds of the ladies and gentlemen who trifled
in such matters, clothed the dry bones. But when the
skeletons were thus padded round and clad, although
built upon folk-lore, they were no longer folk-lore themselves,
for folk-lore can only find a fitting garment in
the language that comes from the mouths of those whose
minds are so primitive that they retain with pleasure
those tales which the more sophisticated invariably
forget. For this reason folk-lore is presented in an uncertain
and unsuitable medium, whenever the contents
of the stories are divorced from their original expression
in language. Seeing how Irish writers have managed it
hitherto, it is hardly to be wondered at that the writer
of the article on folk-lore in the “Encyclopedia Britanica,”
though he gives the names of some fifty authorities
on the subject, has not mentioned a single Irish
collection. In the present book, as well as in my
<span class="irish">Leabhar Sgeuluigheachta</span>, I have attempted—if nothing
else—to be a little more accurate than my predecessors,
and to give the <i>exact language</i> of my informants, together
with their names and various localities—information
which must always be the very first requisite of any
work upon which a future scientist may rely when he
proceeds to draw honey (is it always honey?) from the
flowers which we collectors have culled for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether there still exist in Ireland
many stories of the sort given in this volume. That
is a question which cannot be answered without further
investigation. In any other country the great body of
Gaelic folk-lore in the four provinces would have been
collected long ago, but the “Hiberni incuriosi suorum”
appear at the present day to care little for anything
that is Gaelic; and so their folk-lore has remained practically
uncollected.</p>

<p>Anyone who reads this volume as a representative
one of Irish folk-tales might, at first sight, imagine that
there is a broad difference between the Gaelic tales of
the Highlands and those of Ireland, because very few
of the stories given here have parallels in the volumes
of Campbell and MacInnes. I have, however, particularly
chosen the tales in the present volume on account
of their dissimilarity to any published Highland tales,
for, as a general rule, the main body of tales in Ireland
and Scotland bear a very near relation to each other.
Most of Mr. Curtin’s stories, for instance, have Scotch
Gaelic parallels. It would be only natural, however,
that many stories should exist in Ireland which are now
forgotten in Scotland, or which possibly were never
carried there by that section of the Irish which colonized
it; and some of the most modern—especially of the
kind whose genesis I have called conscious—must have
arisen amongst the Irish since then, while on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
hand some of the Scotch stories may have been bequeathed
to the Gaelic language by those races who
were displaced by the Milesian Conquest in the fifth
century.</p>

<p>Many of the incidents of the Highland stories have
parallels in Irish MSS., even incidents of which I have
met no trace in the folk-lore of the people. This is
curious, because these Irish MSS. used to circulate
widely, and be constantly read at the firesides of the
peasantry, while there is no trace of MSS. being in use
historical times amongst the Highland cabins. Of
such stories as were most popular, a very imperfect list
of about forty is given in Mr. Standish O’Grady’s excellent
preface to the third volume of the Ossianic Society’s
publications. After reading most of these in MSS. of
various dates, and comparing them with such folk-lore
as I had collected orally, I was surprised to find how
few points of contact existed between the two. The
men who committed stories to paper seem to have chiefly
confined themselves to the inventions of the bards or
professional story-tellers—often founded, however, on
folk-lore incidents—while the taste of the people was
more conservative, and willingly forgot the bardic inventions
to perpetuate their old Aryan traditions, of
which this volume gives some specimens. The discrepancy
in style and contents between the MS. stories
and those of the people leads me to believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
stories in the MSS. are not so much old Aryan folk-tales
written down by scholars as the inventions of individual
brains, consciously inventing, as modern novelists do.
This theory, however, must be somewhat modified before
it can be applied, for, as I have said, there are incidents
in Scotch Gaelic folk-tales which resemble those of some
of the MS. stories rather nearly. Let us glance at a
single instance—one only out of many—where Highland
tradition preserves a trait which, were it not for
such preservation, would assuredly be ascribed to the
imaginative brain of an inventive Irish writer.</p>

<p>The extraordinary creature of which Campbell found
traces in the Highlands, the Fáchan, of which he has
drawn a whimsical engraving,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is met with in an Irish
MS. called <span class="irish">Iollann Arm-dearg</span>. Old MacPhie, Campbell’s
informant, called him the “Desert creature of Glen
Eite, the son of Colin,” and described him as having
“one hand out of his chest, one leg out of his haunch,
and one eye out of the front of his face;” and again,
“ugly was the make of the Fáchan, there was one hand
out of the ridge of his chest, and one tuft out of the top
of his head, and it were easier to take a mountain from
the root than to bend that tuft.” This one-legged, one-handed,
one-eyed creature, unknown, as Campbell remarks,
to German or Norse mythology, is thus described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
in the Irish manuscript: “And he (Iollann) was not long
at this, until he saw the devilish misformed element, and
the fierce and horrible spectre, and the gloomy disgusting
enemy, and the morose unlovely churl (<span class="irish">moga</span>); and
this is how he was: he held a very thick iron flail-club
in his skinny hand, and twenty chains out of it, and fifty
apples on each chain of them, and a venomous spell on
each great apple of them, and a girdle of the skins of
deer and roebuck around the thing that was his body,
and one eye in the forehead of his black-faced countenance,
and one bare, hard, very hairy hand coming out
of his chest, and one veiny, thick-soled leg supporting him
and a close, firm, dark blue mantle of twisted hard-thick
feathers, protecting his body, and surely he was more
like unto devil than to man.” This creature inhabited
a desert, as the Highlander said, and were it not for this
corroborating Scotch tradition, I should not have hesitated
to put down the whole incident as the whimsical
invention of some Irish writer, the more so as I had
never heard any accounts of this wonderful creature in
local tradition. This discovery of his counterpart in the
Highlands puts a new complexion on the matter. Is
the Highland spectre derived from the Irish manuscript
story, or does the writer of the Irish story only embody
in his tale a piece of folk-lore common at one time to
all branches of the Gaelic race, and now all but extinct.
This last supposition is certainly the true one, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
borne out by the fact that the Irish writer ascribes no
name to this monster, while the Highlander calls him a
Fáchan,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a word, as far as I know, not to be found
elsewhere.</p>

<p>But we have further ground for pausing before we
ascribe the Irish manuscript story to the invention of
some single bard or writer. If we read it closely we shall
see that it is largely the embodiment of other folk-tales.
Many of the incidents of which it is composed can be
paralleled from Scotch Gaelic sources, and one of the
most remarkable, that of the prince becoming a journeyman
fuller, I have found in a Connacht folk-tale. This
diffusion of incidents in various tales collected all over
the Gaelic-speaking world, would point to the fact that
the story, as far as many of the incidents go, is not the
invention of the writer, but is genuine folk-lore thrown
by him into a new form, with, perhaps, added incidents
of his own, and a brand new dress.</p>

<p>But now in tracing this typical story, we come across
another remarkable fact—the fresh start the story took
on its being thus recast and made up new. Once the
order and progress of the incidents were thus stereotyped,
as it were, the tale seems to have taken a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
lease of its life, and gone forth to conquer; for while it
continued to be constantly copied in Irish manuscripts,
thus proving its popularity as a written tale, it continued
to be recited verbally in Scotland in something like the
same bardic and inflated language made use of by the
Irish writer, and with pretty nearly the same sequence
of incidents, the three adventurers, whose Irish names
are Ur, Artuir, and Iollann, having become transmogrified
into Ur, Athairt, and Iullar, in the mouth of the
Highland reciter. I think it highly improbable, however,
that at the time of this story being composed—largely
out of folk-tale incidents—it was also committed to
paper. I think it much more likely that the story was
committed to writing by some Irish scribe, only after
it had gained so great a vogue as to spread through
both Ireland and Scotland. This would account for the
fact that all the existing MSS. of this story, and of
many others like it, are, as far as I am aware, comparatively
modern.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Another argument in favour of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
supposition, that bardic tales were only committed to
writing when they had become popular, may be drawn
from the fact that both in Ireland and the Highlands we
find in many folk-lore stories traces of bardic compositions
easily known by their poetical, alliterative, and inflated
language, of which no MSS. are found in either country.
It may, of course, be said, that the MSS. have perished;
and we know how grotesquely indifferent the modern
Irish are about their literary and antiquarian remains;
yet, had they ever existed, I cannot help thinking that
some trace of them, or allusion to them, would be found
in our surviving literature.</p>

<p>There is also the greatest discrepancy in the poetical
passages which occur in the Highland oral version and
the Irish manuscript version of such tales as in incident
are nearly identical. Now, if the story had been propagated
from a manuscript written out once for all, and then
copied, I feel pretty sure that the resemblance between
the alliterative passages in the two would be much closer.
The dissimilarity between them seems to show that the
incidents and not the language were the things to be
remembered, and that every wandering bard who picked
up a new story from a colleague, stereotyped the incidents
in his mind, but uttered them whenever he recited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
the story, in his own language; and whenever he came
to the description of a storm at sea, or a battle, or
anything else which the original poet had seen fit to
describe poetically, he did so too, but not in the same
way or the same language, for to remember the language
of his predecessor on these occasions, from merely
hearing it, would be well-nigh impossible. It is likely,
then, that each bard or story-teller observed the places
where the poetical runs should come in, but trusted to
his own cultivated eloquence for supplying them. It
will be well to give an example or two from this tale of
Iollann. Here is the sea-run, as given in the Highland
oral version, after the three warriors embark in their
vessel:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“They gave her prow to sea and her stern to shore,</div>
<div class="verse">They hoisted the speckled flapping bare-topped sails,</div>
<div class="verse">Up against the tall tough splintering masts,</div>
<div class="verse">And they had a pleasant breeze as they might chose themselves,</div>
<div class="verse">Would bring heather from the hill, leaf from grove, willow from its roots,</div>
<div class="verse">Would put thatch of the houses in furrows of the ridges,</div>
<div class="verse">The day that neither the son nor the father could do it,</div>
<div class="verse">That same was neither little nor much for them,</div>
<div class="verse">But using it and taking it as it might come.</div>
<div class="verse">The sea plunging and surging,</div>
<div class="verse">The red sea the blue sea lashing,</div>
<div class="verse">And striking hither and thither about her planks,</div>
<div class="verse">The whorled dun whelk that was down on the floor of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Would give a <i>snag</i> on her gunwale and a crack on her floor,</div>
<div class="verse">She would cut a slender oaten straw with the excellence of her going.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be observed how different the corresponding
run in the Irish manuscript is, when thrown into verse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
for the language in both versions is only measured
prose:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Then they gave an eager very quick courageous high-spirited flood-leap</div>
<div class="verse">To meet and to face the sea and the great ocean.</div>
<div class="verse">And great was the horror....</div>
<div class="verse">Then there arose before them a fierceness in the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">And they replied patiently stoutly strongly and vigorously,</div>
<div class="verse">To the roar of the green sided high-strong waves,</div>
<div class="verse">Till they made a high quick very-furious rowing</div>
<div class="verse">Till the deep-margined dreadful blue-bordered sea</div>
<div class="verse">Arose in broad-sloping fierce-frothing plains</div>
<div class="verse">And in rushing murmuring flood-quick ever-deep platforms.</div>
<div class="verse">And in gloomy horrible swift great valleys</div>
<div class="verse">Of very terrible green sea, and the beating and the pounding</div>
<div class="verse">Of the strong dangerous waves smiting against the decks</div>
<div class="verse">And against the sides of that full-great full-tight bark.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may, however, be objected that the sea-runs are so
common and so numerous, that one might easily usurp
the place of another, and that this alone is no proof that
the various story-tellers or professional bards, contented
themselves with remembering the incidents of a story,
but either extemporised their own runs after what
flourish their nature would, or else had a stock of these,
of their own composing, always ready at hand. Let us
look, then, at another story of which Campbell has preserved
the Highland version, while I have a good Irish
MS. of the same, written by some northern scribe, in
1762. This story, “The Slender Grey Kerne,” or “Slim
Swarthy Champion,” as Campbell translates it, is full of
alliterative runs, which the Highland reciter has retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
in their proper places, but couched in different
language, while he introduces a run of his own which
the Irish has not got, in describing the swift movement
of the kerne. Every time the kerne is asked where he
comes from, the Highlander makes him say—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I came from hurry-skurry,</div>
<div class="verse">From the land of endless spring,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></div>
<div class="verse">From the loved swanny glen,</div>
<div class="verse">A night in Islay and a night in Man,</div>
<div class="verse">A night on cold watching cairns</div>
<div class="verse">On the face of a mountain.</div>
<div class="verse">In the Scotch king’s town was I born,</div>
<div class="verse">A soiled sorry champion am I</div>
<div class="verse">Though I happened upon this town.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the Irish MS. the kerne always says—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In Dun Monaidh, in the town of the king of Scotland,</div>
<div class="verse">I slept last night,</div>
<div class="verse">But I be a day in Islay and a day in Cantire,</div>
<div class="verse">A day in Man and a day in Rathlin,</div>
<div class="verse">A day in Fionncharn of the watch</div>
<div class="verse">Upon Slieve Fuaid.</div>
<div class="verse">A little miserable traveller I,</div>
<div class="verse">And in Aileach of the kings was I born.</div>
<div class="verse">And that,” said he, “is my story.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, whenever the kerne plays his harp the Highlander
says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“He could play tunes and <i>oirts</i> and <i>orgain</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">Trampling things, tightening strings,</div>
<div class="verse">Warriors, heroes, and ghosts on their feet,</div>
<div class="verse">Ghosts and souls and sickness and fever,</div>
<div class="verse">That would set in sound lasting sleep</div>
<div class="verse">The whole great world,</div>
<div class="verse">With the sweetness of the calming<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> tunes</div>
<div class="verse">That the champion would play.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Irish run is as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The kerne played music and tunes and instruments of song,</div>
<div class="verse">Wounded men and women with babes,</div>
<div class="verse">And slashed heroes and mangled warriors,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the wounded and all the sick,</div>
<div class="verse">And the bitterly-wounded of the great world,</div>
<div class="verse">They would sleep with the voice of the music,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever efficacious, ever sweet, which the kerne played.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, when the kerne approaches anyone, his gait
is thus described half-rythmically by the Scotch narrator:—“A
young chap was seen coming towards them,
his two shoulders through his old coat, his two ears
through his old hat, his two squat kickering tatter-y shoes
full of cold roadway-ish water, three feet of his sword
sideways in the side of his haunch after the scabbard
was ended.”</p>

<p>The Irish writer makes him come thus:—“And he
beheld the slender grey kerne approaching him straight,
and half his sword bared behind his haunch, and old shoes
full of water sousing about him, and the top of his ears
out through his old mantle, and a short butt-burned
javelin of holly in his hand.”</p>

<p>These few specimens, which could be largely multiplied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
may be sufficient for our purpose, as they show that
wherever a run occurs in the Irish the same occurs in
the Gaelic, but couched in quite different language,
though preserving a general similarity of meaning. This
can only be accounted for on the supposition already
made, that when a professional bard had invented a
successful story it was not there and then committed to
paper, but circulated <i>vivâ voce</i>, until it became the property
of every story-teller, and was made part of the
stock-in-trade of professional <i>filès</i>, who neither remembered
nor cared to remember the words in which the
story was first told, but only the incidents of which it
was composed, and who (as their professional training
enabled them to do) invented or extemporised glowing
alliterative runs for themselves at every point of the
story where, according to the inventor of it, a run
should be.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note that this particular story
cannot—at least in the form in which we find it disseminated
both in Ireland and Scotland—be older than
the year 1362, in which year O’Connor Sligo marched
into Munster and carried off great spoil, for in both the
Scotch and Irish versions the kerne is made to accompany
that chieftain, and to disappear in disgust because
O’Connor forgot to offer him the first drink. This story
then, and it is probably typical of a great many others,
had its rise in its present shape—for, of course, the germ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
of it may be much older—on Irish ground, not earlier
than the end of the fourteenth or the beginning of the
fifteenth century, and was carried by some Irish bard or
professional story-teller to the Gaeldom of Scotland, where
it is told to this day without any great variations, but
in a form very much stunted and shortened. As to
the Irish copy, I imagine that it was not written down
for a couple of centuries later, and only after it had
become a stock piece all over the Scotch and Irish
Gaeldom; that then some scribe got hold of a story-teller
(one of those professionals who, according to the Book
of Leinster, were obliged to know seven times fifty stories),
and stereotyped in writing the current Irish variation of
the tale, just as Campbell, two, three, or four centuries
afterwards, did with the Scotch Gaelic version.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be alleged that the bombastic and
inflated language of many of the MS. stories is due not
to the oral reciter, but to the scribe, who, in his pride of
learning, thought to himself, <i>nihil quod tango non orno</i>;
but though it is possible that some scribes threw in extraneous
embellishments, I think the story-teller was
the chief transgressor. Here, for instance, is a verbally
collected specimen from a Connemara story, which contains
all the marks of the MS. stories, and yet it is
almost certain that it has been transmitted purely <i>vivâ
voce</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>—“They journeyed to the harbour where there was
a vessel waiting to take them across the sea. They
struck into her, and hung up the great blowing, bellying,
equal-long, equal-straight sails, to the tops of the masts,
so that they would not leave a rope without straining,
or an oar without breaking, plowing the seething, surging
sea; great whales making fairy music and service for
them, two-thirds going beneath the wave to the one-third
going on the top, sending the smooth sand down below
and the rough sand up above, and the eels in grips with
one another, until they grated on port and harbour in
the Eastern world.” This description is probably nothing
to the glowing language which a professional
story-teller, with a trained ear, enormous vocabulary,
and complete command of the language, would have
employed a couple of hundred years ago. When such
popular traces of the inflated style even still exist, it is
against all evidence to accredit the invention and propagation
of it to the scribes alone.</p>

<p>The relationship between Ireland and the Scottish
Gaeldom, was of the closest kind, and there must have been
something like an identity of literature, nor was there any
break in the continuity of these friendly relations until
the plantation of Ulster cut off the high road between
the two Gaelic families. Even during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries it is probable that no sooner did
a bardic composition win fame in Ireland than it was
carried over to try its fortune in Scotland too, just as an
English dramatic company will come over from London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
to Dublin. A story which throws great light on the dispersion
of heroic tales amongst the Gaelic-speaking
peoples, is Conall Gulban, the longest of all Campbell’s
tales. On comparing the Highland version with an Irish
MS., by Father Manus O’Donnell, made in 1708, and
another made about the beginning of this century, by
Michael O’Longan, of Carricknavar, I was surprised to
find incident following incident with wonderful regularity
in both versions. Luckily we have proximate data for
fixing the date of this renowned story, a story that,
according to Campbell, is “very widely spread in Scotland,
from Beaulay on the east, to Barra on the west,
and Dunoon and Paisley in the south.” Both the Irish
and Gaelic stories relate the exploits of the fifth century
chieftain, Conall Gulban, the son of Niall of the Nine
Hostages, and his wars with (amongst others) the Turks.
The Irish story begins with an account of Niall holding
his court, when a herald from the Emperor of Constantinople
comes forward and summons him to join the
army of the emperor, and assist in putting down Christianity,
and making the nations of Europe embrace the
Turkish faith. We may fairly surmise that this romance
took its rise in the shock given to Europe by the fall of
Constantinople and the career of Mahomet the Great.
This would throw back its date to the latter end of the
fifteenth century at the earliest; but one might almost
suppose that Constantinople had been long enough held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
by the Turks at the time the romance was invented to
make the inventor suppose that it had always belonged to
them, even in the time of Niall of the Nine Hostages.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
We know that romances of this kind continued to be
invented at a much later date, but I fancy none of these
ever penetrated to Scotland. One of the most popular
of romantic tales with the scribes of the last century and
the first half of this, was “The Adventures of Torolbh MacStairn,”
and again, the “Adventures of Torolbh MacStairn’s
Three Sons,” which most of the MSS. ascribe to Michael
Coiminn, who lived at the beginning of the eighteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and whose romance was certainly not propagated
by professional story-tellers, as I have tried to prove
was the case with the earlier romances, but by means of
numerous manuscript copies; and it is also certain that
Coiminn did not relate this tale as the old bards did, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
wrote it down as modern novelists do their stories. But
this does not invalidate my surmise, or prove that Conall
Gulban, and forty or fifty of the same kind, had their
origin in a written manuscript; it only proves that in the
eighteenth century the old order was giving place to the
new, and that the professional bards and story-tellers
were now a thing of the past, they having fallen with the
Gaelic nobility who were their patrons. It would be
exceedingly interesting to know whether any traces of
these modern stories that had their rise in written manuscripts,
are to be found amongst the peasantry as folk-lore.
I, certainly, have found no remnant of any such;
but this proves nothing. If Ireland had a few individual
workers scattered over the provinces we would know more
on the subject; but, unfortunately, we have hardly any such
people, and what is worse, the present current of political
thought, and the tone of our Irish educational establishments
are not likely to produce them. Until something
has been done by us to collect Irish folk-lore in as
thorough a manner as Highland tales have already been
collected, no deductions can be made with certainty
upon the subject of the relationship between Highland
and Irish folk-tales, and the relation of both to the
Irish MSS.</p>

<p>Irish folk-stories may roughly be divided into two
classes, those which I believe never had any <i>conscious</i>
genesis inside the shores of Ireland, and those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
had. These last we have just been examining. Most of
the <i>longer</i> tales about the Fenians, and all those stories
which have long inflated passages full of alliterative
words and poetic epithets, belong to this class. Under
the other head of stories that were never consciously
invented on Irish ground, we may place all such simple
stories as bear a trace of nature myths, and those which
appear to belong to our old Aryan heritage, from the fact
of their having parallels amongst other Aryan-speaking
races, such as the story of the man who wanted to learn to
shake with fear, stories of animals and talking birds, of
giants and wizards, and others whose directness and
simplicity show them to have had an unconscious and
popular origin, though some of these may, of course,
have arisen on Irish soil. To this second class belong
also that numerous body of traditions rather than tales,
of conversational anecdotes rather than set stories, about
appearances of fairies, or “good people,” or Tuatha De
Danann, as they are also called; of pookas, leprechauns,
ghosts, apparitions, water-horses, &amp;c. These creations
of folk-fancy seldom appear, as far as I have observed,
in the folk-tale proper, or at least they only appear as
adjuncts, for in almost all cases the interest of these
regular tales centres round a human hero. Stories about
leprechauns, fairies, &amp;c., are very brief, and generally
have local names and scenery attached to them, and are
told conversationally as any other occurrence might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
told, whereas there is a certain solemnity about the repetition
of a folk-tale proper.</p>

<p>After spending so much time over the very latest
folk-tales, the detritus of bardic stories, it will be well to
cast a glance at some of the most ancient, such as bear
their pre-historic origin upon their face. Some of these
point, beyond all doubt, to rude efforts on the part of
primitive man to realize to himself the phenomena of
nature, by personifying them, and attaching to them
explanatory fables. Let us take a specimen from a story
I found in Mayo, not given in this volume—“The Boy
who was long on his Mother.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In this story, which in
Von Hahn’s classification would come under the heading
of “the strong man his adventures,” the hero is a veritable
Hercules, whom the king tries to put to death by
making him perform impossible tasks, amongst other
things, by sending him down to hell to drive up the
spirits with his club. He is desired by the king to drain
a lake full of water. The lake is very steep on one side
like a reservoir. The hero makes a hole at this side,
applies his mouth to it, and sucks down the water of the
lake, with boats, fishes, and everything else it contained,
leaving the lake <span class="irish">ċoṁ tirm le bois do láiṁe</span>, “as dry as
the palm of your hand.” Even a sceptic will be likely to
confess that this tale (which has otherwise no meaning)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
is the remains of a (probably Aryan) sun-myth, and
personifies the action of the warm sun in drying up a
lake and making it a marsh, killing the fishes, and leaving
the boats stranded. But this story, like many others, is
suggestive of more than this, since it would supply an
argument for those who, like Professor Rhys, see in
Hercules a sun-god. The descent of our hero into hell,
and his frightening the spirits with his club, the impossible
tasks which the king gives him to perform in the
hopes of slaying him, and his successful accomplishment
of them, seem to identify him with the classic Hercules.
But the Irish tradition preserves the incident of drying
the lake, which must have been the work of a sun-god, the
very thing that Hercules—but on much slighter grounds—is
supposed to have been.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> If this story is not the remains
of a nature myth, it is perfectly unintelligible, for no
rational person could hope to impose upon even a child
by saying that a man drank up a lake, ships, and all;
and yet this story has been with strange conservatism
repeated from father to son for probably thousands of
years, and must have taken its rise at a time when our
ancestors were in much the same rude and mindless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
condition as the Australian blacks or the Indians of
California are to-day.</p>

<p>Again, in another story we hear of a boat that sails
equally swiftly over land and sea, and goes straight to
its mark. It is so large that if all the men in the world
were to enter it there would remain place for six hundred
more; while it is so small that it folds up into the hand
of the person who has it. But ships do not sail on land,
nor grow large and small, nor go straight to their mark;
consequently, it is plain that we have here another
nature myth, vastly old, invented by pre-historic man,
for these ships can be nothing but the clouds which sail
over land and sea, are large enough to hold the largest
armies, and small enough to fold into the hand, and
which go straight to their mark. The meaning of this
has been forgotten for countless ages, but the story has
survived.</p>

<p>Again, in another tale which I found, called “The
Bird of Sweet Music,”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a man follows a sweet singing
bird into a cave under the ground, and finds a country
where he wanders for a year and a day, and a woman
who befriends him while there, and enables him to bring
back the bird, which turns out to be a human being.
At the end of the tale the narrator mentions quite
casually that it was his mother whom he met down there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
But this touch shows that the land where he wandered
was the Celtic Hades, the country of the dead beneath
the ground, and seems to stamp the tale at once as at
least pre-Christian.</p>

<p>Even in such an unpretending-looking story as “The
King of Ireland’s Son” (the third in this volume), there
are elements which must be vastly old. In a short
Czech story, “George with the Goat,” we find some of
the prince’s companions figuring, only slightly metamorphosed.
We have the man with one foot over his
shoulder, who jumps a hundred miles when he puts it
down; while the gun-man of the Irish story who performs
two parts—that of seeing and shooting—is replaced
in the Bohemian tale by two different men, one of whom
has such sight that he must keep a bandage over his
eyes, for if he removed it he could see a hundred miles,
and the other has, instead of a gun, a bottle with
his thumb stuck into it for a stopper, because if he
took it out it would squirt a hundred miles. George
hires one after the other, just as the prince does in
the Irish story. George goes to try to win the king’s
daughter, as the Irish prince does, and, amongst other
things, is desired to bring a goblet of water from a well
a hundred miles off in a minute. “So,” says the story,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
“George said to the man who had the foot on his
shoulder, ‘You said that if you took the foot down you
could jump a hundred miles.’ He replied: ‘I’ll easily
do that.’ He took the foot down, jumped, and was there;
but after this there was only a very little time to spare,
and by this he ought to have been back. So George
said to the second, ‘You said that if you removed the
bandage from your eyes you could see a hundred miles;
peep, and see what is going on.’ ‘Ah, sir, goodness
gracious! he’s fallen asleep.’ ‘That will be a bad job,’
said George; ‘the time will be up. You third man, you
said if you pulled your thumb out you could squirt a
hundred miles. Be quick, and squirt thither, that he
may get up; and you, look whether he is moving, or
what.’ ‘Oh, sir, he’s getting up now; he’s knocking
the dust off; he’s drawing the water.’ He then gave a
jump, and was there exactly in time.” Now, this Bohemian
story seems also to bear traces of a nature myth;
for, as Mr. Wratislaw has remarked: “the man who
jumps a hundred miles appears to be the rainbow, the
man with bandaged eyes the lightning, and the man
with the bottle the cloud.” The Irish story, while in
every other way superior to the Bohemian, has quite
obscured this point; and were it not for the striking
Sclavonic parallel, people might be found to assert that
the story was of recent origin. This discovery of the
Czech tale, however, throws it at once three thousand
years back; for the similarity of the Irish and Bohemian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
story can hardly be accounted for, except on the supposition,
that both Slavs and Celts carried it from the
original home of the Aryan race, in pre-historic times,
or at least from some place where the two races were in
contiguity with one another, and that it, too—little as it
appears so now—was at one time in all probability a
nature myth.</p>

<p>Such myth stories as these ought to be preserved,
since they are about the last visible link connecting
civilized with pre-historic man; for, of all the traces
that man in his earliest period has left behind him, there
is nothing except a few drilled stones or flint arrow-heads
that approaches the antiquity of these tales, as
told to-day by a half-starving peasant in a smoky Connacht
cabin.</p>

<p>It is time to say a word about the narrators of these
stories. The people who can recite them are, as far as
my researches have gone, to be found only amongst the
oldest, most neglected, and poorest of the Irish-speaking
population. English-speaking people either do not know
them at all, or else tell them in so bald and condensed
a form as to be useless. Almost all the men from
whom I used to hear stories in the County Roscommon
are dead. Ten or fifteen years ago I used to hear
a great many stories, but I did not understand their
value. Now when I go back for them I cannot find
them. They have died out, and will never again be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
heard on the hillsides, where they probably existed for a
couple of thousand years; they will never be repeated
there again, to use the Irish phrase, while grass grows
or water runs. Several of these stories I got from an old
man, one Shawn Cunningham, on the border of the
County Roscommon, where it joins Mayo. He never
spoke more than a few words of English till he was
fifteen years old. He was taught by a hedge schoolmaster
from the South of Ireland out of Irish MSS. As far as I
could make out from him the teaching seemed to consist
in making him learn Irish poems by heart. His next
schoolmaster, however, tied a piece of stick round his
neck, and when he came to school in the morning the
schoolmaster used to inspect the piece of wood and pretend
that it told him how often he had spoken Irish
when at home. In some cases the schoolmasters made
the parents put a notch in the stick every time the child
failed to speak English. He was beaten then, and always
beaten whenever he was heard speaking a word of Irish,
even though at this time he could hardly speak a word of
English. His son and daughter now speak Irish, though
not fluently, his grandchildren do not even understand
it. He had at one time, as he expressed it, “the full of
a sack of stories,” but he had forgotten them. His
grandchildren stood by his knee while he told me one
or two, but it was evident they did not understand a
word. His son and daughter laughed at them as nonsense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
Even in Achill where, if anywhere, one ought to
find folk-stories in their purity, a fine-looking dark man
of about forty-five, who told me a number of them, and
could repeat Ossian’s poems, assured me that now-a-days
when he went into a house in the evening and the
old people got him to recite, the boys would go out;
“they wouldn’t understand me,” said he, “and when they
wouldn’t, they’d sooner be listening to <span class="irish">géimneaċ na mbó</span>,”
“the lowing of the cows.” This, too, in an island where
many people cannot speak English. I do not know
whether the Achill schoolmasters make use of the notch
of wood to-day, but it is hardly wanted now. It is
curious that this was the device universally employed
all over Connacht and Munster to kill the language.
This took place under the eye of O’Connell and the Parliamentarians,
and, of course, under the eye and with
the sanction of the Catholic priesthood and prelates,
some of whom, according to Father Keegan, of St.
Louis, distinguished themselves by driving the Irish
teachers out of their dioceses and burning their books.
At the present day, such is the irony of fate, if a
stranger talks Irish he runs a good chance of being
looked upon as an enemy, this because some attempts
were made to proselytize “natives” by circulating Irish
bibles, and sending some Irish scripture-readers amongst
them. Surely nothing so exquisitely ludicrous ever took
place outside of this island of anomalies, as that a stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
who tries to speak Irish in Ireland runs the serious risk
of being looked upon as a proselytizing Englishman.
As matters are still progressing gaily in this direction,
let nobody be surprised if a pure Aryan language which,
at the time of the famine, in ’47, was spoken by at
least four million souls (more than the whole population
of Switzerland), becomes in a few years as extinct as
Cornish. Of course, there is not a shadow of necessity,
either social or economical, for this. All the world
knows that bi-linguists are superior to men who know
only one language, yet in Ireland everyone pretends to
believe the contrary. A few words from the influential
leaders of the race when next they visit Achill, for instance,
would help to keep Irish alive there in <i>sæcula
sæculorum</i>, and with the Irish language, the old Aryan
folk-lore, the Ossianic poems, numberless ballads, folk-songs,
and proverbs, and a thousand and one other interesting
things that survive when Irish is spoken, and
die when it dies. But, from a complexity of causes which
I am afraid to explain, the men who for the last sixty
years have had the ear of the Irish race have persistently
shown the cold shoulder to everything that was Irish and
racial, and while protesting, or pretending to protest,
against West Britonism, have helped, more than anyone
else, by their example, to assimilate us to England and
the English, thus running counter to the entire voice of
modern Europe, which is in favour of extracting the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
from the various races of men who inhabit it, by helping
them to develop themselves on national and racial lines.
The people are not the better for it either, for one would
fancy it required little culture to see that the man who
reads Irish MSS., and repeats Ossianic poetry, is a higher
and more interesting type than the man whose mental
training is confined to spelling through an article in
<i>United Ireland</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>I may mention here that it is not as easy a thing as
might be imagined to collect Irish stories. One hears
that tales are to be had from such and such a man,
generally, alas! a very old one. With difficulty one
manages to find him out, only to discover, probably, that
he has some work on hand. If it happens to be harvest
time it is nearly useless going to him at all, unless one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
is prepared to sit up with him all night, for his mind is
sure to be so distraught with harvest operations that he
can tell you nothing. If it is winter time, however, and you
fortunately find him unoccupied, nevertheless it requires
some management to get him to tell his stories. Half a
glass of <i>ishka-baha</i>, a pipe of tobacco, and a story of one’s
own are the best things to begin with. If, however, you
start to take down the story <i>verbatim</i> with pencil and
paper, as an unwary collector might do, you destroy all,
or your shanachie becomes irritable. He will not wait
for you to write down your sentence, and if you call out,
“Stop, stop, wait till I get this down,” he will forget
what he was going to tell you, and you will not get a
third of his story, though you may think you have it all.
What you must generally do is to sit quietly smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
your pipe, without the slightest interruption, not even
when he comes to words and phrases which you do not
understand. He must be allowed his own way to the
end, and then after judiciously praising him and discussing
the story, you remark, as if the thought had
suddenly struck you, “<span class="irish">buḋ ṁaiṫ liom sin a ḃeiṫ agam air
ṗáipeur</span>,” “I’d like to have that on paper.” Then you
can get it from him easily enough, and when he leaves
out whole incidents, as he is sure to do, you who have
just heard the story can put him right, and so get it
from him nearly in its entirety. Still it is not always
easy to write down these stories, for they are full of
old or corrupted words, which neither you nor your
narrator understand, and if you press him too much
over the meaning of these he gets confused and irritable.</p>

<p>The present volume consists of about half the stories
in the <i>Leabhar Sgeuluigheachta</i>, translated into English,
together with some half dozen other stories given in the
original together with a close English translation. It is
not very easy to make a good translation from Irish into
English, for there are no two Aryan languages more
opposed to each other in spirit and idiom. Still, the
English spoken by three-fourths of the people of Ireland
is largely influenced by Gaelic idioms, for most of those
expressions which surprise Englishmen are really translations
from that Irish which was the language of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
speaker’s father, grandfather, or great-grandfather—according
to the part of the country you may be in—and
there have perpetuated themselves, even in districts
where you will scarce find a trace of an Irish word.
There are, however, also hundreds of Gaelic idioms not
reproduced in the English spoken by the people, and it
is difficult to render these fitly. Campbell of Islay has
run into rather an extreme in his translations, for in
order to make them picturesque, he has rendered his
Gaelic originals something too literally. Thus, he invariably
translates <i>bhain se an ceann deth</i>, by “he reaped
the head off him,” a form of speech which, I notice, a
modern Irish poet and M.P. has adopted from him; but
bain, though it certainly means “reap” amongst other
things, is the word used for taking off a hat as well as a
head. Again, he always translates <i>thu</i> by “thou,” which
gives his stories a strange antique air, which is partly
artificial, for the Gaelic “thou” corresponds to the
English “you,” the second person plural not being used
except in speaking of more than one. In this way,
Campbell has given his excellent and thoroughly reliable
translations a scarcely legitimate colouring, which I have
tried to avoid. For this reason, I have not always translated
the Irish idioms quite literally, though I have used
much unidiomatic English, but only of the kind used all
over Ireland, the kind the people themselves use. I do
not translate, for instance, the Irish for “he died,” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
“he got death,” for this, though the literal translation,
is not adopted into Hibernian English; but I do translate
the Irish <i>ghnidheadh se sin</i> by “he used to do that,”
which is the ordinary Anglo-Irish attempt at making—what
they have not got in English—a consuetudinal
tense. I have scarcely used the pluperfect at all. No
such tense exists in Irish, and the people who speak
English do not seem to feel the want of it, and make no
hesitation in saying, “I’d speak sooner if I knew that,”
where they mean, “if I had known that I would have
spoken sooner.” I do not translate (as Campbell would),
“it rose with me to do it,” but “I succeeded in doing
it,” for the first, though the literal translation of the
Irish idiom, has not been adopted into English; but I do
translate “he did it and he drunk,” instead of, “he did
it while he was drunk;” for the first phrase (the literal
translation of the Irish) is universally used throughout
English-speaking Ireland. Where, as sometimes happens,
the English language contains no exact equivalent for an
Irish expression, I have rendered the original as well
as I could, as one generally does render for linguistic
purposes, from one language into another.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it only remains for me to thank Mr.
Alfred Nutt for enriching this book as he has done, and
for bearing with the dilatoriness of the Irish printers,
who find so much difficulty in setting Irish type, that
many good Irishmen have of late come round to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
idea of printing our language in Roman characters; and
to express my gratitude to Father Eugene O’Growney
for the unwearying kindness with which he read and
corrected my Irish proofs, and for the manifold aid which
he has afforded me on this and other occasions.</p>

<h2 id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT BY ALFRED NUTT.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/deco3.jpg" width="125" height="15" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I had hoped to accompany these tales with as full a commentary as that which
I have affixed to the Argyllshire <i>Märchen</i>, collected and translated by the
Rev. D. MacInnes. Considerations of business and health prevent me from
carrying out this intention, and I have only been able to notice a passage here
and there in the Tales; but I have gladly availed myself of my friend, Dr.
Hyde’s permission, to touch upon a few points in his Introduction.</p>

<p>Of special interest are Dr. Hyde’s remarks upon the relations which obtain
between the modern folk-tale current among the Gaelic-speaking populations
of Ireland and Scotland, and the Irish mythic, heroic and romantic literature
preserved in MSS., which range in date from the eleventh century to the present
day.</p>

<p>In Ireland, more than elsewhere, the line of demarcation between the tale
whose genesis is conscious, and that of which the reverse is true, is hard to
draw, and students will, for a long while to come, differ concerning points of
detail. I may thus be permitted to disagree at times with Dr. Hyde, although,
as a rule, I am heartily at one with him.</p>

<p>Dr. Hyde distinguishes between an older stratum of folk-tale (the “old
Aryan traditions,” of <a href="#Page_xix">p. xix.</a>) and the newer stratum of “bardic inventions.”
He also establishes a yet younger class than these latter, the romances of the
professional story-tellers of the eighteenth century, who “wrote them down as
modern novelists do their stories.” Of these last he remarks (<a href="#Page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv.</a>), that
he has found no remnant of them among the peasantry of to-day; a valuable
bit of evidence, although of course, subject to the inconclusiveness of all merely
negative testimony. To revert to the second class, he looks upon the tales
comprised in it as being rather the inventions of individual brains than as old
Aryan folk-tales (<a href="#Page_xx">p. xx.</a>) It must at once be conceded, that a great number
of the tales and ballads current in the Gaelic-speaking lands undoubtedly received
the form under which they are now current, somewhere between the
twelfth and the sixteenth centuries; that the authors of that form were equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
undoubtedly the professional bards and story-tellers attached to the court of
every Gaelic chieftain; and that the method of their transmission was oral,
it being the custom of the story-tellers both to teach their tales to pupils, and
to travel about from district to district.</p>

<p>The style of these stories and ballads enables us to date them with sufficient
precision. Dr. Hyde also notes historical allusions, such as the reference to
O’Connor Sligo, in the story of the “Slim Swarthy Champion,” or to the Turks
in the story of “Conall Gulban.” I cannot but think, however, that it is straining
the evidence to assert that the one story was invented after 1362, or the other
after the fall of Constantinople. The fact that “Bony” appears in some versions
of the common English mumming play does not show that it originated
in this century, merely that these particular versions have passed through the
minds of nineteenth century peasants; and in like manner the Connaught
fourteenth century chieftain may easily have taken the place of an earlier personage,
the Turks in “Conall Gulban,” of an earlier wizard-giant race. If I
cannot go as far as Dr. Hyde in this sense, I must equally demur to the assumption
(<a href="#Page_xl">p. xl.</a>), that community of incident between an Irish and a
Bohemian tale necessarily establishes the pre-historic antiquity of the incident.
I believe that a great many folk-tales, as well as much else of folk-lore, has
been developed <i>in situ</i>, rather than imported from the outside; but I, by no means,
deny importation in principle, and I recognise that its agency has been clearly
demonstrated in not a few cases.</p>

<p>The main interest of Irish folk-literature (if the expression be allowed)
centres in the bardic stories. I think that Dr. Hyde lays too much stress
upon such external secondary matters as the names of heroes, or allusions to
historical events; and, indeed, he himself, in the case of Murachaidh MacBrian,
states what I believe to be the correct theory, namely, that the Irish
bardic story, from which he derives the Scotch Gaelic one, is, as far as many
of its incidents go, not the invention of the writer, but genuine folk-lore
thrown by him into a new form (<a href="#Page_xxii">p. xxii.</a>)</p>

<p>Had we all the materials necessary for forming a judgment, such is, I
believe, the conclusion that would in every case be reached. But I furthermore
hold it likely that in many cases the recast story gradually reverted
to a primitive folk-type in the course of passing down from the court story-teller
to the humbler peasant reciters, that it sloughed off the embellishments
of the <i>ollamhs</i>, and reintroduced the older, wilder conceptions with which
the folk remained in fuller sympathy than the more cultured bard. Compare,
for instance, as I compared ten years ago, “Maghach Colgar,” in
Campbell’s version (No. 36), with the “Fairy Palace of the Quicken
Trees.” The one tale has all the incidents in the wildest and most fantastic
form possible; in the other they are rationalised to the utmost possible extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>
and made to appear like a piece of genuine history. I do not think that if
this later version was <i>invented</i> right out by a thirteenth or fourteenth century
<i>ollamh</i>, it could have given rise to the former one. Either “Maghach Colgar”
descends from the folk-tale which served as the basis of the Irish story,
or, what is more likely, the folk, whilst appreciating and preserving the new
arrangement of certain well-known incidents, retained the earlier form of the
incidents themselves, as being more consonant with the totality of its conceptions,
both moral and æsthetic. This I hold to be the vital lesson the folk-lorist
may learn from considering the relations of Gaelic folk-tale and Gaelic
romance (using the latter term in the sense of story with a conscious genesis):
that romance, to live and propagate itself among the folk, must follow certain
rules, satisfy certain conceptions of life, conform to certain conventions. The
Irish bards and story-tellers had little difficulty, I take it, in doing this;
they had not outgrown the creed of their countrymen, they were in substantial
touch with the intellectual and artistic laws that govern their subject-matter.
Re-arrange, rationalise somewhat, deck out with the questionable
adornment of their scanty and ill-digested book-learning—to this extent,
but to this extent only, I believe, reached their influence upon the mass of
folk-conceptions and presentments which they inherited from their fathers,
and which, with these modifications and additions, they handed on to their
children.</p>

<p>But romance must not only conform to the conventions, it must also fit in
with the <i>ensemble</i> of conditions, material, mental and spiritual, which constitute
the culture (taking this much-abused word in its widest sense) of a
race. An example will make this clear.</p>

<p>Of all modern, consciously-invented fairy tales I know but one which conforms
fully to the folk-tale convention—“The Shaving of Shagpat.” It
follows the formula as closely and accurately as the best of Grimm’s or of
Campbell’s tales. To divine the nature of a convention, and to use its
capabilities to the utmost, is a special mark of genius, and in this, as in other
instances, whatever else be absent from Mr. Meredith’s work, genius is
indubitably present. But I do not think that “The Shaving of Shagpat”
could ever be acclimatised as a folk-tale in this country. Scenery, conduct
of story, characterisation of personages, are all too distinctively Oriental.
But let an Eastern admirer of Mr. Meredith translate his work into
Arabic or Hindi, and let the book fall into the hands of a Cairene or
Delhi story-teller (if such still exist), I can well imagine that, with judicious
cuts, it should win praise for its reciter in market-place or bazaar. Did this
happen, it would surely be due to the fact that the story is strictly constructed
upon traditional lines, rather than to the brilliant invention and fancy displayed
on every page. Strip from it the wit and philosophy of the author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
and there remains a fairy tale to charm the East; but it would need to be
reduced to a skeleton, and reclothed with new flesh before it could charm
the folk of the West.</p>

<p>To bring home yet more clearly to our minds this necessity for romance to
conform to convention, let us ask ourselves, what would have happened if one
of the Irish story-tellers who perambulated the Western Isles as late as the
seventeenth century, had carried with him a volume of Hakluyt or Purchas, or,
supposing one to have lingered enough, Defoe or Gil Blas? Would he have
been welcomed when he substituted the new fare for the old tales of “Finn and
the Fians?” and even if welcomed, would he have gained currency for it?
Would the seed thus planted have thriven, or would it not rather, fallen upon
rocky places, have withered away?</p>

<p>It may, however, be objected that the real difference lies not so much in
the subject-matter as in the mode of transmission; and the objection may
seem to derive some force from what Dr. Hyde notes concerning the prevalence
of folk-tales in Wicklow, and the nearer Pale generally, as contrasted
with Leitrim, Longford, and Meath (<a href="#Page_xii">p. xii.</a>). It is difficult to
over-estimate the interest and importance of this fact, and there can
hardly be a doubt that Dr. Hyde has explained it correctly. It may,
then, be urged that so long as oral transmission lasts the folk-tale
flourishes; and only when the printed work ousts the story-teller is it that
the folk-tale dies out. But this reasoning will not hold water. It is absurd
to contend that the story-teller had none but a certain class of materials at
his disposal till lately. He had the whole realm of intellect and fancy to draw
upon; but he, and still more his hearers, knew only one district of that
realm; and had it been possible for him to step outside its limits his hearers
could not have followed him. I grant folk fancy has shared the fortunes of
humanity together with every other manifestation of man’s activity, but always
within strictly defined limits, to transgress which has always been to forfeit
the favour of the folk.</p>

<p>What, then, are the characteristic marks of folk-fancy? The question is
of special interest in connection with Gaelic folk-lore. The latter is rich in
transitional forms, the study of which reveal more clearly than is otherwise
possible the nature and workings of the folk-mind.</p>

<p>The products of folk-fancy (putting aside such examples of folk-wisdom
and folk-wit as proverbs, saws, jests, etc.), may be roughly divided among
two great classes:</p>

<p>Firstly, stories of a quasi-historical or anecdotic nature, accepted as actual
fact (of course with varying degrees of credence) by narrator and hearer.
Stories of this kind are very largely concerned with beings (supernatural, as
we should call them) differing from man, and with their relations to and dealings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
with man. Not infrequently, however, the actors in the stories are
wholly human, or human and animal. Gaelic folk-lore is rich in such stories,
owing to the extraordinary tenacity of the fairy belief. We can hardly doubt
that the Gael, like all other races which have passed through a certain stage of
culture, had at one time an organised hierarchy of divine beings. But we
have to piece together the Gaelic god-saga out of bare names, mere hints, and
stories which have evidently suffered vital change. In the earliest stratum of
Gaelic mythic narrative we find beings who at some former time had occupied
divine rank, but whose relations to man are substantially, as therein presented,
the same as those of the modern fairy to the modern peasant. The chiefs of
the Tuatha de Danann hanker after earthly maidens; the divine damsels long
for and summon to themselves earthly heroes. Though undying, very strong,
and very wise, they may be overpowered or outwitted by the mortal hero.
As if conscious of some source of weakness we cannot detect, they are
anxious, in their internecine struggles, to secure the aid of the sons of men.
Small wonder that this belief, which we can follow for at least 1,200 years,
should furnish so many elements to the folk-fancy of the Gael.</p>

<p>In stories of the second class the action is relegated to a remote past—once
upon a time—or to a distant undefined region, and the narrative is not
necessarily accepted as a record of actual fact. Stories of this class, whether
in prose or verse, may again be subdivided into—humorous, optimistic,
tragic; and with regard to the third sub-division, it should be noted that the
stories comprised in it are generally told as having been true once, though not
in the immediate tangible sense of stories in the first class.</p>

<p>These different narrative groups share certain characteristics, though in
varying proportions.</p>

<p>Firstly, the fondness for and adherence to a comparatively small number
of set formulas. This is obviously less marked in stories of the first class,
which, as being in the mind of the folk a record of what has actually happened,
partake of the diversity of actual life. And yet the most striking
similarities occur; such an anecdote, for instance, as that which tells how a
supernatural changeling is baffled by a brewery of egg-shells being found
from Japan to Brittany.</p>

<p>Secondly, on the moral side, the unquestioning acceptance of fatalism,
though not in the sense which the Moslem or the Calvinist would attach to the
word. The event is bound to be of a certain nature, provided a certain mode
of attaining it be chosen. This comes out well in the large group of stories
which tell how a supernatural being helps a mortal to perform certain tasks,
as a rule, with some ulterior benefit to itself in view. The most disheartening
carelessness and stupidity on the part of the man cannot alter the result; the
skill and courage of the supernatural helper are powerless without the mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
co-operation. In what I have termed the tragic stories, this fatalism puts on
a moral form, and gives rise to the conception of Nemesis.</p>

<p>Thirdly, on the mental side, animism is prevalent, <i>i.e.</i>, the acceptance of a
life common to, not alone man and animals, but all manifestations of force.
In so far as a distinction is made between the life of man and that of
nature at large, it is in favour of the latter, to which more potent energy is
ascribed.</p>

<p>Just as stories of the first class are less characterised by adherence to formula,
so stories of the humorous group are less characterised by fatalism and
animism. This is inevitable, as such stories are, as a rule, concerned solely
with the relations of man to his fellows.</p>

<p>The most fascinating and perplexing problems are those connected with
the groups I have termed optimistic and tragic. To the former belong the
almost entirety of such nursery tales as are not humorous in character.
“They were married and lived happily ever afterwards;” such is the almost
invariable end formula. The hero wins the princess, and the villain is
punished.</p>

<p>This feature the nursery tale shares with the god-saga; Zeus confounds
the Titans, Apollo slays the Python, Lug overcomes Balor, Indra vanquishes
Vritra. There are two apparent exceptions to this rule. The Teutonic god
myth is tragic; the Anses are ever under the shadow of the final conflict.
This has been explained by the influence of Christian ideas; but although this
influence must be unreservedly admitted in certain details of the passing of
the gods, yet the fact that the Iranian god-saga is likewise undecided, instead
of having a frankly optimistic ending, makes me doubt whether the drawn
battle between the powers of good and ill be not a genuine and necessary part
of the Teutonic mythology. As is well known, Rydberg has established
some striking points of contact between the mythic ideas of Scandinavia
and those of Iran.</p>

<p>In striking contradiction to this moral, optimistic tendency are the great
heroic sagas. One and all well-nigh are profoundly tragic. The doom of Troy
the great, the passing of Arthur, the slaughter of the Nibelungs, the death of
Sohrab at his father’s hands, Roncevalles, Gabhra, the fratricidal conflict of
Cuchullain and Ferdiad, the woes of the house of Atreus; such are but a few
examples of the prevailing tone of the hero-tales. Achilles and Siegfried and
Cuchullain are slain in the flower of their youth and prowess. Of them, at
least, the saying is true, that whom the gods love die young. Why is it not
equally true of the prince hero of the fairy tale? Is it that the hero-tale associated
in the minds of hearers and reciters with men who had actually lived
and fought, brought down to earth, so to say, out of the mysterious wonderland
in which god and fairy and old time kings have their being, becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
thereby liable to the necessities of death and decay inherent in all human
things? Some scholars have a ready answer for this and similar questions.
The heroic epos assumed its shape once for all among one special race, and
was then passed on to the other races who remained faithful to the main lines
whilst altering details. If this explanation were true, it would still leave
unsolved the problem, why the heroic epos, which for its fashioners and hearers
was at once a record of the actual and an exemplar of the ideal, should,
among men differing in blood and culture, follow one model, and that a tragic
one. Granting that Greek and Teuton and Celt did borrow the tales which
they themselves conceived to be very blood and bone of their race, what
force compelled them all to borrow one special conception of life and fate?</p>

<p>Such exceptions as there are to the tragic nature of the heroic saga are
apparent rather than real. The Odyssey ends happily, like an old-fashioned
novel, but Fénélon long ago recognised in the Odyssey—“un amas de
contes de vieille.”</p>

<p>Perseus again has the luck of a fairy-tale prince, but then the story of his
fortunes is obviously a fairy-tale, with named instead of anonymous personages.</p>

<p>Whilst the fairy-tale is akin in tone to the god saga, the ballad recalls the
heroic epos. The vast majority of ballads are tragic. Sir Patrick Spens
must drown, and Glasgerion’s leman be cheated by the churl; Clerk Saunders
comes from the other world, like Helge to Sigrun; Douglas dreams his dreary
dream, “I saw a dead man win a fight, and that dead man was I.” The
themes of the ballad are the most dire and deadly of human passions;
love scorned or betrayed, hate, and revenge. Very seldom, too, do the
plots of ballad and märchen cross or overlap. Where this does happen it
will, as a rule, be found that both are common descendants of some great
saga.</p>

<p>We find such an instance in the Fenian saga, episodes of which have lived
on in the Gaelic folk memory in the double form of prose and poetry. But it
should be noted that the poetry accentuates the tragic side—the battle of
Gabhra, the death of Diarmaid—whilst the prose takes rather some episode
of Finn’s youth or manhood, and presents it as a rounded and complete whole,
the issue of which is fortunate.</p>

<p>The relations of myth and epos to folk-lore may thus be likened to that of
trees to the soil from which they spring, and which they enrich and fertilize
by the decay of their leaves and branches which mingle indistinguishably with
the original soil. Of this soil, again, rude bricks may be made, and a house
built; let the house fall into ruins, and the bricks crumble into dust, it will be
hard to discriminate that dust from the parent earth. But raise a house of
iron or stone, and, however ruined, its fragments can always be recognised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
In the case of the Irish bardic literature the analogy is, I believe, with soil
and tree, rather than with soil and edifice.</p>

<p>Reverting once more to the characteristics of folk-fancy, let us note that
they appear equally in folk-practice and folk-belief. The tough conservatism
of the folk-mind has struck all observers: its adherence to immemorial formulas;
its fatalistic acceptance of the mysteries of nature and heredity,
coupled with its faith in the efficacy of sympathetic magic; its elaborate
system of custom and ritual based upon the idea that between men and the
remainder of the universe there is no difference of kind.</p>

<p>A conception of the Cosmos is thus arrived at which, more than any religious
creed, fulfils the test of catholicity; literally, and in the fullest significance
of the words, it has been held <i>semper, ubique et ab omnibus</i>. And of this
conception of the universe, more universal than any that has as yet swayed the
minds of man, it is possible that men now living may see the last flickering
remains; it is well-nigh certain that our grandchildren will live in a world out
of which it has utterly vanished.</p>

<p>For the folk-lorist the Gospel saying is thus more pregnant with meaning
than for any other student of man’s history—“the night cometh wherein no
man may work.” Surely, many Irishmen will take to heart the example of
Dr. Hyde, and will go forth to glean what may yet be found of as fair and
bounteous a harvest of myth and romance as ever flourished among any race.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_I">AN TAILIUR AGUS NA TRI ḂEIṪIGEAĊ.</h2>

<p>Ḃí táiliúr aon uair aṁam i nGailliṁ, agus ḃí sé ag
fuaiġeál eudaiġ. Ċonnairc se dreancuid ag éiriġe
amaċ as an eudaċ agus ċaiṫ se an tsnáṫad léiṫe agus
ṁarḃ sé an dreancuid. Duḃairt se ann sin “Naċ breáġ
an gaisgiḋeaċ mise nuair a ḃí mé abalta air an dreancuid
sin do ṁarḃaḋ!”</p>

<p>Duḃairt sé ann sin go gcaiṫfeaḋ sé dul go B’l’acliaṫ
go cúirt an ríġ, go ḃfeicfeaḋ sé an dtiucfaḋ leis a
deunaṁ. Ḃí an ċúirt sin ’gá ḋeunaṁ le fada, aċt an
méad dí do gníṫiḋe ann san lá do leagaiḋe ann san oiḋċe
é, agus níor ḟeud duine air biṫ a ċur suas mar ġeall
air sin. ’S iad tri ḟáṫaċ a ṫigeaḋ ’san oiḋċe a ḃideaḋ
’gá leagaḋ. D’imṫiġ an táiliúr an lá air na ṁáraċ
agus do ṫug se leis an uirlis, an spád agus an tsluasad.</p>

<p>Níor ḃfada ċuaiḋ sé gur casaḋ capall bán dó, agus
ċuir se forán air. “Go mbeannuiġ Dia ḋuit,” ar san
capall, “cá ḃfuil tu dul?” “Tá mé dul go B’l’acliaṫ,”
ar san táiliúr, “le deunaṁ cúirte an ríġ, go ḃfáġ mé
bean-uasal, má ṫig liom a deunaṁ,” mar do ġeall an
ríġ go dtiúḃfaḋ sé a inġean féin agus a lán airgid
léiṫe don té sin a ṫiucfaḋ leis an ċúirt sin do ċur suas.
“An ndeunfá poll dam?” ar san sean-ġearrán bán,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“raċainn i ḃfolaċ ann nuair atá na daoine mo ṫaḃairt
ċum an ṁuilinn agus ċum an aṫa i rioċt naċ ḃfeidfiḋ siad
mé, óir tá mé cráiḋte aca, ag deunaṁ oibre ḋóiḃ.”
“Deunfaiḋ mé sin go deiṁin,” ar san táiliúr, “agus
fáilte.” Ṫug sé an spád leis agus an tsluasad, agus
rinne sé poll, agus duḃairt sé leis an g-capall bán dul
síos ann, go ḃfeicfeaḋ sé an ḃfóirfeaḋ sé ḋó. Ċuaiḋ an
capall bán síos ann san bpoll, aċt nuair d’ḟeuċ sé do
ṫeaċt suas arís as, níor ḟeud sé.</p>

<p>“Deun áit dam anois,” ar san capall bán, “a ṫiucfas
mé aníos as an bpoll so nuair a ḃéiḋeas ocaras orm.”
“Ní ḋeunfad,” ar san táiliúr, “fan ann sin go dtigiḋ
mé air m’ais, agus tógfaiḋ mé aníos ṫu.”</p>

<p>D’imṫiġ an táiliúr an lá air na máraċ, agus casaḋ
ḋó an sionnaċ, “Go mbeannuiġ Dia ḋuit,” ar san
sionnaċ. “Go mbeannuiġ Dia ’gus Muire ḋuit.” “Cá
ḃfuil tu dul?” “Tá mé dul go B’l’acliaṫ go ḃfeuċaiḋ
mé an dtiucfaiḋ liom cúirt ḋeunaṁ do’n ríġ.” “An
ndeunfá áit dam, a raċfainn i ḃfolaċ innti,” ar san
sionnaċ, “tá an ċuid eile de na sionnaiġiḃ do m’ ḃualaḋ
agus ní leigeann siad dam aon niḋ iṫe ’nna g-cuideaċta.”
“Deunfaiḋ mé sin duit,” ar san táiliúr. Ṫug sé leis a
ṫuaġ agus a ṡáḃ agus ḃain se slata, go ndearnaiġ sé,
mar ḋeurfá, cliaḃ dó, agus duḃairt sé leis an tsionnaċ
dul síos ann, go ḃfeicfeaḋ se an ḃfóirfeaḋ sé ḋó.
Ċuaid an sionnaċ ann, agus nuair fuair an táiliúr ṡíos
é, leag sé a ṫóin air an bpoll a ḃí ann. Nuair a ḃí an
sionnaċ sásta faoi ḋeireaḋ go raiḃ áit ḋeas aige d’iarr
sé air an táiliúr a leigean amaċ, agus d’ḟreagair an
táiliúr naċ leigfeaḋ, “Fan ann sin go dtigiḋ mise air
m’ais,” ar sé.</p>

<p>D’imṫiġ an táiliúr an lá air na ṁáraċ, agus ní fada
ḃí sé siúḃal gur casaḋ madr’-alla ḋó, agus ċuir an
mádr’-alla forán air, agus dḟiafruiġ sé ḋé cá raiḃ sé
ag triall. “Tá me dul go B’l’acliaṫ go ndeunfaiḋ mé
cúirt do’n ríġ má ṫig liom sin ḋeunaṁ,” ar san táiliúr.
“Dá ndeunfá ceuċt dam,” ar san madr’-alla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> “ḃeiḋeaḋ
mise agus na madr’-alla eile ag treaḃaḋ agus ag
forsaḋ, go mbeiḋeaḋ greim againn le n-iṫe ann san
ḃfóġṁar.” “Deunfaiḋ mé sin duit,” ar san táiliúr.
Ṫug sé leis a ṫuaġ ’s a ṡáḃ, agus rinne sé ceuċt. Nuair
ḃí an ceuċt deunta ċuir sé poll ann san mbéam (sail)
agus duḃairt se leis an madr’-alla dul asteaċ faoi an
g-ceuċt go bḟeicfeaḋ sé an raiḃ treaḃaċ maiṫ ann. Ċuir
sé a earball asteaċ ann san bpoll a rinne sé, agus ċuir
sé “peg” ann-sin ann, agus níor ṫáinig leis an madr’-alla
a earball ṫarraing amaċ as arís. “Sgaoil mé
anois,” ar ran madr’-alla, “agus deasóċamaoid féin agus
treaḃfamaoid.” Duḃairt an táiliúr naċ sgaoilfeaḋ sé
é no go dtiucfaḋ sé féin air ais. D’ḟág sé ann sin é agus
ċuaiḋ sé go B’l’acliaṫ.</p>

<p>Nuair ṫáinig sé go B’l’acliaṫ ċuir sé páipeur amaċ an
méad luċd’ céirde do ḃí ag tógḃáil na cúirte do teaċt
ċuige-sean, agus go n-íocfaḋ seisean iad——agus ní
ḃíḋeaḋ daoine ag fáġail ’san am sin aċt píġin ’san lá.
Do ċruinniġ a lán luċd céirde an lá air na ṁáraċ, agus
ṫosaiġ siad ag obair dó. Ḃí siad ag dul a ḃaile anḋiaiġ
an laé nuair duḃairt an tailiúr leó “an ċloċ ṁór
sin do ċur suas air ḃárr na h-oibre a ḃí deunta aige.”
Nuair d’ árduiġeaḋ suas an ċloċ ṁór sin, ċuir an tailiúr
sliġe éigin fúiṫi go leagfaḋ sé anuas í nuair a ṫiucfaḋ
an faṫaċ ċoṁ fada léiṫe. D’imṫiġ an luċd oibre a ḃaile
ann sin, agus ċuaiḋ an tailiúr i ḃfolaċ air ċúl na cloiċe
móire. Nuair ṫáinig dorċadas na h-oiḋċe ċonnairc sé na
trí faṫaiġ ag teaċt, agus ṫosuiġ siad ag leagaḋ na
cúirte no go dtáinig siad ċoṁ fada leis an áit a raiḃ an

gan leagan, ó ḃí fear aca féin marḃ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Ṫáinig an luċt céirde arís, an lá air na ṁáraċ, agus
ḃí siad ag obair go dtí an oiḋċe, agus nuair a ḃí siad
dul aḃaile duḃairt an tailiúr leó an ċloċ ṁór do ċur
suas air ḃárr na h-oibre mar ḃí rí an oiḋċe roiṁe sin.
Rinne siad sin dó, agus d’imṫiġ siad aḃaile, agus cuaiḋ
an tailiúr i ḃfolaċ, mar ḃí sé an traṫnóna roiṁe sin.
Nuair ḃí na daoine uile imṫiġṫe ’nna suaiṁneas, ṫáinig
an dá ḟaṫaċ, agus ḃí siad ag leagan an ṁéid a ḃí

Ḃí an tailiúr air siúḃal agus é ag obair no gur leag sé
anuas an ċloċ ṁór gur ṫuit sí air ċloigionn an ḟaṫaiġ a
ḃí fúiṫi agus ṁarḃ sí é. Ní raiḃ ann sin aċt an t-aon
ḟaṫaċ aṁáin ann, agus ní ṫáinig seisean go raiḃ an
ċúirt críoċnuiġṫe.</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ an táiliúr ċum an riġ ann sin, agus duḃairt sé
leis, a ḃean agus a ċuid airgid do ṫaḃairt dó, mar do
ḃí an ċúirt déanta aige, aċt duḃairt an ríġ leis naċ
dtiúḃraḋ sé aon ḃean dó, no go marḃfaḋ sé an faṫaċ
eile, agus naċ dtiúḃraḋ sé dadaṁ dó anois no go
marḃfaḋ sé an fear deireannaċ. Duḃairt an táiliúr
ann sin go marḃfaḋ sé an faṫaċ eile ḋó, agus fáilte,
naċ raiḃ aon ṁaille air biṫ air sin.</p>

<p>D’imṫiġ an táiliúr ann sin, go dtáinig sé ċum na
h-áite a raiḃ an faṫaċ eile, agus d’ḟiafruiġ ar ṫeastuig
buaċaill uaiḋ. Duḃairt an faṫaċ gur ṫeastuiġ,
dá ḃfáġaḋ sé buaċaill a ḋeunfaḋ an rud a deunfaḋ sé
féin. “Rud air biṫ a ḋeunfas tusa, deunfaiḋ mise é,”
ar san tailiúr.</p>

<p>Ċuaid siad ċum a ndinéir ann sin, agus nuair ḃí sé
iṫte aca duḃairt an faṫaċ leis an táiliúr an dtiucfaḋ
leis an oiread anḃruiṫ ól agus é féin, aníos as a ḟiucaḋ.
“Tiucfaiḋ,” ar san tailiúr, “aċt go dtiúḃraiḋ tu uair
dam sul a ṫosóċamaoid air.” “Ḃéarfaiḋ mé sin duit,”
ar san faṫac. Ċuaiḋ an tailiúr amaċ ann sin, agus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fuair se croicionn caoraċ agus d’ḟuaiġ sé suas é, go
ndearnaiġ sé mála ḋé agus ḋeasuiġ sé ṡíos faoi na ċóta
é. Táinig sé asteaċ ann sin, agus duḃairt sé leis an
ḃfaṫaċ galún de’n anḃruiṫ ól i dtosaċ. D’ól an faṫaċ
sin aníos as a ḟiuċaḋ.</p>

<p>“Deunfaiḋ mise sin,” ar san táiliúr. Ḃí sé air
siúḃal gur ḋóirt sé asteaċ san g-croicionn é, agus ṡaoil
an faṫaċ go raiḃ sé ólta aige. D’ól an faṫaċ galún
eile ann sin, agus leig an táiliúr galún eile síos ’san
g-croicionn, aċt ṡaoil an faṫaċ, go raiḃ sé ’gá ól. “Déanfaiḋ
mise rud anois naċ dtiucfaiḋ leat-sa ḋeunaṁ,” ar
san táiliúr. “Ní ḋéanfá,” ar san faṫaċ, “creud é sin
do ḋéanfá?”</p>

<p>“Poll do ḋeunaṁ, agus an t-anḃruiṫ do leigean
amaċ arís,” ar san táiliúr. “Déan ṫu féin i dtosaċ é,”
ar san faṫaċ. Ṫug an táiliúr “prad” de’n sgín, agus
leig sé amaċ an t-anḃruiṫ as an g-croicionn. “Déan,
ṫusa, sin,” ar sé leis an ḃfaṫaċ. “Déanfad,” ar san
faṫaċ ag taḃairt prad de’n sgín ’nna ḃuilg féin gur
ṁarḃ sé é féin. Sin é an ċaoi a ṁarḃ sé an tríoṁaḋ
faṫaċ.</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ sé do’n ríġ ann sin, agus duḃairt sé leis, an
ḃean agus a ċuid airgid do ċur amaċ ċuige, agus go
leagfaḋ se an ċúirt muna ḃfáġaḋ sé an ḃean. Bí faitċios
orra ann sin go leagfaḋ sé an ċúirt arís, agus
cuir siad an ḃean amaċ ċuige.</p>

<p>Nuair ḃí sé lá imṫiġṫe, é féin agus a ḃean, ġlac siad
aiṫreaċas agus lean siad é, go mbainfeaḋ siad an ḃean
dé arís. Bí an ṁuinntir do ḃí ’nna ḋiaiġ ’gá leanaṁaint

Nuair ċualaiḋ siad sin sgaoil siad amaċ an madr’alla.</p>

<p>D’imṫig an madr’-alla agus muinntir Ḃ’l’acliaṫ, agus
ḃí siad dá leanaṁaint go dtáinig siad d’on áit a raiḃ

<p>Nuair ċonnairc an táiliúr iad ag tíġeaċt ṫáinig sé

<h2>THE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS.</h2>

<p>There was once a tailor in Galway, and he was sewing
cloth. He saw a flea springing up out of the cloth, and
he threw his needle at it and killed it. Then he said:
“Am I not a fine hero when I was able to kill that
flea?”</p>

<p>Then he said that he must go to Blackleea (Dublin), to
the king’s court, to see would he be able to build it.
That court was a’building for a long time; but as much
of it as would be made during the day used to be thrown
down again during the night, and for that reason nobody
could build it up. It was three giants who used to come
in the night and throw it. The day on the morrow the
tailor went off, and brought with him his tools, the
spade and the shovel.</p>

<p>He had not gone far till he met a white horse, and he
saluted him.</p>

<p>“God save you,” said the horse. “Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Dublin,” said the tailor, “to build a
court for the king, and to get a lady for a wife, if I am
able to do it;” for the king had promised that he would
give his own daughter, and a lot of money with her, to
whoever would be able to build up his court.</p>

<p>“Would you make me a hole,” said the old white
garraun (horse),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> “where I could go a’hiding whenever the
people are for bringing me to the mill or the kiln, so that
they won’t see me, for they have me perished doing work
for them?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, indeed,” said the tailor, “and welcome.”</p>

<p>He brought the spade and shovel, and he made a hole,
and he said to the old white horse to go down into it till
he would see if it would fit him. The white horse went
down into the hole, but when he tried to come up again
he was not able.</p>

<p>“Make a place for me now,” said the white horse,
“by which I’ll come up out of the hole here, whenever
I’ll be hungry.”</p>

<p>“I will not,” said the tailor; “remain where you are
until I come back, and I’ll lift you up.”</p>

<p>The tailor went forward next day, and the fox met him.</p>

<p>“God save you,” said the fox.</p>

<p>“God and Mary save you.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to Dublin, to try will I be able to make a
court for the king.”</p>

<p>“Would you make a place for me where I’d go hiding?”
said the fox. “The rest of the foxes do be beating
me, and they don’t allow me to eat anything along with
them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that for you,” said the tailor.</p>

<p>He took with him his axe and his saw, and he cut
rods, until he made, as you would say, a thing like a
cleeve (creel), and he desired the fox to get into it till he
would see whether it would fit him. The fox went into
it, and when the tailor got him down, he clapped his
thigh on the hole that the fox got in by. When the fox
was satisfied at last that he had a nice place of it within,
he asked the tailor to let him out, and the tailor answered
that he would not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait there until I come back again,” says he.</p>

<p>The tailor went forward the next day, and he had not
walked very far until he met a modder-alla (lion?) and
the lion greeted him, and asked him where was he going.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Dublin till I make a court for the king,
if I’m able to make it,” said the tailor.</p>

<p>“If you were to make a plough for me,” said the lion,
“I and the other lions could be ploughing and harrowing
until we’d have a bit to eat in the harvest.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that for you,” said the tailor.</p>

<p>He brought his axe and his saw, and he made a plough.
When the plough was made, he put a hole in the beam of
it, and he said to the lion to go in under the plough till
he’d see was he any good of a ploughman. He placed the
tail in the hole he had made for it, and then clapped in
a peg, and the lion was not able to draw out his tail again.</p>

<p>“Loose me out now,” said the lion, “and we’ll fix ourselves
and go ploughing.”</p>

<p>The tailor said he would not loose him out until he
came back himself. He left him there then, and he came
to Dublin.</p>

<p>When he came to Dublin he put forth a paper, desiring
all the tradesmen that were raising the court to come
to him, and that he would pay them; and at that time
workmen used only to be getting one penny in the day.
A number of tradesmen gathered the next day, and
they began working for him. They were going home
again after their day, when the tailor said to them “to
put up that great stone upon the top of the work that they
had done.” When the great stone was raised up, the
tailor put some sort of contrivance under it, that he might
be able to throw it down as soon as the giant would come
as far as it. The work people went home then, and the
tailor went in hiding behind the big stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>When the darkness of the night was come he saw the
three giants arriving, and they began throwing down the
court until they came as far as the place where the tailor
was in hiding up above, and a man of them struck a blow
of his sledge on the place where he was. The tailor threw
down the stone, and it fell on him and killed him. They
went home then, and left all of the court that was remaining
without throwing it down, since a man of themselves
was dead.</p>

<p>The tradespeople came again the next day, and they
were working until night, and as they were going home
the tailor told them to put up the big stone on the top of
the work, as it had been the night before. They did
that for him, went home, and the tailor went in hiding
the same as he did the evening before.</p>

<p>When the people had all gone to rest, the two giants
came, and they were throwing down all that was before
them, and as soon as they began they put two shouts out
of them. The tailor was going on manœuvring until he
threw down the great stone, and it fell upon the skull of
the giant that was under him, and it killed him. There was
only the one giant left in it then, and he never came
again until the court was finished.</p>

<p>Then when the work was over he went to the king
and told him to give him his wife and his money, as
he had the court finished, and the king said he would
not give him any wife, until he would kill the other
giant, for he said that it was not by his strength he
killed the two giants before that, and that he would
give him nothing now until he killed the other one
for him. Then the tailor said that he would kill the
other giant for him, and welcome; that there was no
delay at all about that.</p>

<p>The tailor went then, till he came to the place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the other giant was, and asked did he want a servant-boy.
The giant said he did want one, if he could get one
who would do everything that he would do himself.</p>

<p>“Anything that you will do, I will do it,” said the
tailor.</p>

<p>They went to their dinner then, and when they had it
eaten, the giant asked the tailor “would it come with him
to swallow as much broth as himself, up out of its boiling.”
The tailor said: “It will come with me to do that,
but that you must give me an hour before we begin on
it.” The tailor went out then, and he got a sheepskin,
and he sewed it up till he made a bag of it, and he
slipped it down under his coat. He came in then and
said to the giant to drink a gallon of the broth himself
first. The giant drank that, up out of its boiling.
“I’ll do that,” said the tailor. He was going on until
he had it all poured into the skin, and the giant thought
he had it drunk. The giant drank another gallon then,
and the tailor let another gallon down into the skin, but
the giant thought he was drinking it.</p>

<p>“I’ll do a thing now that it won’t come with you to
do,” said the tailor.</p>

<p>“You will not,” said the giant. “What is it you
would do?”</p>

<p>“Make a hole and let out the broth again,” said the
tailor.</p>

<p>“Do it yourself first,” said the giant.</p>

<p>The tailor gave a prod of the knife, and he let the
broth out of the skin.</p>

<p>“Do that you,” said he.</p>

<p>“I will,” said the giant, giving such a prod of the knife
into his own stomach, that he killed himself. That is the
way he killed the third giant.</p>

<p>He went to the king then, and desired him to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
him out his wife and his money, for that he would throw
down the court again, unless he should get the wife.
They were afraid then that he would throw down the
court, and they sent the wife out to him.</p>

<p>When the tailor was a day gone, himself and his wife,
they repented and followed him to take his wife off him
again. The people who were after him were following
him till they came to the place where the lion was, and
the lion said to them: “The tailor and his wife were
here yesterday. I saw them going by, and if ye loose
me now, I am swifter than ye, and I will follow them
till I overtake them.” When they heard that they
loosed out the lion.</p>

<p>The lion and the people of Dublin went on, and they
were pursuing him, until they came to the place where
the fox was, and the fox greeted them, and said: “The
tailor and his wife were here this morning, and if ye
will loose me out, I am swifter than ye, and I will
follow them, and overtake them.” They loosed out the
fox then.</p>

<p>The lion and the fox and the army of Dublin went on
then, trying would they catch the tailor, and they were
going till they came to the place where the old white
garraun was, and the old white garraun said to them that
the tailor and his wife were there in the morning, and
“loose me out,” said he; “I am swifter than ye, and I’ll
overtake them.” They loosed out the old white garraun
then, and the old white garraun, the fox, the lion, and
the army of Dublin pursued the tailor and his wife together,
and it was not long till they came up with him,
and saw himself and the wife out before them.</p>

<p>When the tailor saw them coming he got out of the
coach with his wife, and he sat down on the ground.</p>

<p>When the old white garraun saw the tailor sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
down on the ground, he said: “That’s the position he
had when he made the hole for me, that I couldn’t come
up out of, when I went down into it. I’ll go no nearer
to him.”</p>

<p>“No!” said the fox, “but that’s the way he was
when he was making the thing for me, and I’ll go no
nearer to him.”</p>

<p>“No!” says the lion, “but that’s the very way he had,
when he was making the plough that I was caught in.
I’ll go no nearer to him.”</p>

<p>They all went from him then and returned. The
tailor and his wife came home to Galway. They gave
me paper stockings and shoes of thick milk. I lost
them since. They got the ford, and I the flash;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> they
were drowned, and I came safe.</p>

<h2>BRAN.</h2>

<p>Finn had a splendid hound. That was Bran. You
have heard talk of Bran. This is the colour was on him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yellow feet that were on Bran,</div>
<div class="verse">Two black sides, and belly white,</div>
<div class="verse">Grayish back of hunting colour,</div>
<div class="verse">Two ears, red, round, small, and bright.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bran would overtake the wild-geese, she was that swift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
There arose some quarrel or fighting between the hounds
that the Fenians had, when she was only a puppy, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Three score hounds and twenty puppies</div>
<div class="verse">Bran did kill, and she a puppy,</div>
<div class="verse">Two wild-geese, as much as they all.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was Finn himself who killed Bran. They went out
hunting, and there was made a fawn of Finn’s mother.
(<i>Who made a fawn of her? Oh, how do I know? It was
with some of their pishtrogues.</i>) Bran was pursuing her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Silly fawn leave on mountain,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">said Finn. “Oh, young son,” said she, “how shall I
escape?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If I go in the sea beneath</div>
<div class="verse">I never shall come back again,</div>
<div class="verse">And if I go in the air above</div>
<div class="verse">My swiftness is no match for Bran.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Go out between my two legs,” said Finn.</p>

<p>She went between his two legs, and Bran followed
her; and as Bran went out under him, Finn squeezed
his two knees on her and killed her.</p>

<p>Bran had a daughter. That pup was a black hound,
and the Fenians reared it; and they told the woman
who had a charge of the pup to give it the milk of a cow
without a single spot, and to give it every single drop,
and not to keep back one tint<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> from her. The woman
did not do that, but kept a portion of the milk without
giving it to the pup.</p>

<p>The first day that the Fenians loosed out the young
hound, there was a glen full of wild-geese and other
birds; and when the black hound was loosed amongst
them, she caught them all except a very few that went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
out on a gap that was in it. (<i>And how could she catch
the wild-geese? Wouldn’t they fly away in the air? She
caught them, then. That’s how I heard it.</i>) And only that
the woman kept back some of the milk from her, she
would have killed them all.</p>

<p>There was a man of the Fenians, a blind man, and
when the pup was let out, he asked the people near him
how did the young hound do. They told him that the
young hound killed all the wild-geese and birds that
were in the glen, but a few that went out on a gap. “If
she had to get all the milk that came from the cow without
spot,” says the blind man, “she wouldn’t let a bird
at all go from her.” And he asked then “how was the
hound coming home?” “She’s coming now,” said they,
“and a fiery cloud out of her neck,” (<i>How out of her
neck? Because she was going so quick.</i>) “and she coming
madly.”</p>

<p>“Grant me my request now,” said the blind man. “Put
me sitting in the chair, and put a coal<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>(?) in my hand;
for unless I kill her she’ll kill us.”</p>

<p>The hound came, and he threw the coal at her and
killed her, and he blind.</p>

<p>But if that pup had to get all the milk, she’d come and
she’d lie down quietly, the same as Bran used to lie
ever.</p>

<p>“Raċfad,” ar san fear, “má ḃfáġ’ mé mo ṫuarastal.”</p>

<p>“Agus cad é an tuarastal ḃéiḋeas tu ’g iarraiḋ?”</p>

<p>“Áit tíġe agus garḋa.”</p>

<p>“Geoḃaiḋ tu sin uaim, má éiriġeann mo ṫuras liom.”</p>

<p>D’imṫiġ Mac Ríġ Eireann leis an ḃfear glas agus

<p>“Tá sé ċoṁ maiṫ ḋuit an fear sin ġlacaḋ air

<p>D’ḟiafruiġ Mac Ríġ Eireann de ’n ḟear an dtiucfaḋ

<p>“Geoḃaiḋ tu sin uaim má éiriġeann an rud atá ann

<p>Ċuaiḋ Mac Riġ Eireann, an fear gearr glas, an gunnaire,

casaḋ fear eile ḋóiḃ agus a leaṫ-ċos air a ġualainn,
agus é ag congḃáil páirce geirrḟiaḋ gan aon ġeirrḟiaḋ

Eireann agus d’ḟiafruiġ sé cad é an ċiall a raiḃ a leaṫ-ċos

<p>“O,” ar seisean, “dá mbeiḋeaḋ mo ḋá ċois agam air

<p>“An dtiucfaiḋ tu air aimsir liom,” ar san Mac Riġ.</p>

<p>“Tiucfad, má ḃfáġ’ mé áit tiġe agus garḋa.”</p>

<p>“Geoḃaiḋ tu sin uaim,” ar Mac Ríġ Éireann, “má

<p>Ċuaiḋ Mac Riġ Eireann, an fear gearr glas, an gunnaire,
an cluasaire, agus an coisire air aġaiḋ, agus níor

<p>“Cad ċuige ḃfuil do ṁeur agad air do ṡrón?” ar Mac
Ríġ Eireann leis.</p>

<p>“O,” ar seisean, “dá séidfinn as mo ḋá ṗolláire do

<p>“An dtiucfaiḋ tu air aimsir?”</p>

<p>“Tiucfad, má ḃfáġ’ mé áit tiġe agus garḋa.”</p>

<p>“Geoḃaiḋ tu sin, má éiriġeann an rud atá ann mo

<p>Ċuaiḋ Mac Riġ Eireann, an fear gearr glas, an gunnaire,

go fear a ḃí ’nna ṡuiḋe air ṫaoiḃ an ḃoṫair, agus

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“An dtiucfaiḋ tu air aimsir liom?”</p>

<p>“Tuicfad, má ḃfaġ’ mé áit tíġe agus garḋa.”</p>

<p>D’imṫiġ siad uile ann sin, Mac Ríġ Eireann, an fear

<p>Ḍearc Mac Ríġ Éireann uaiḋ agus ní ḟacaiḋ sé aon

Duḃairt mac ríġ Éireann naċ raiḃ ḟios aige cá ċaiṫfeaḋ

<p>Ṫáinig siad ċum an tiġe, agus ṫarraing an fear gearr

<p>“Ní Éireannaċ binn breugaċ mise,” ar san fear gearr

Ḃí an fear gearr glas ag meuduġaḋ, agus ag meuduġaḋ

faitċios air an ḃfaṫaċ agus duḃairt sé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> “Ḃfuil do

<p>“Tá,” ar san fear gearr glas, “agus níos mó.”</p>

<p>“Cuir i ḃfolaċ mé go maidin go n-imṫiġeann do ṁáiġistir,”
ar san faṫaċ.</p>

<p>Ċuir sé an faṫaċ faoi ġlas, ann sin, agus ċuaiḋ sé

<p>Ṫáinig mac ríġ Éireann, an fear gearr glas, an gunnaire,

<p>Nuair d’ éiriġ an lá air na ṁáraċ ṫug sé leis a

<p>“Is fearr dam a ṫaḃairt duit,” ar san faṫaċ, “agus

<p>Ḃí siad ag imṫeaċt ann sin. Do ḃéarfaḋ siad air

agus ċuaiḋ sé ċum an ċaisleáin, agus ṫarraing sé an

<p>Ṫáinig an faṫaċ amaċ, agus duḃairt sé, “Moṫuiġim

<p>“Ní Eireannaċ binn breugaċ mise,” ar san fear gearr

<p>“Is mór líom ḋe ġreim ṫu, agus is beag liom de ḋá

<p>“Ní ḃfuiġfiḋ tu mé de ġreim air biṫ,” ar san fear gearr

<p>Ṫáinig faitċios air an ḃfaṫaċ agus duḃairt sé,
“ḃfuil do ṁáiġistir ċoṁ mór leat-sa?”</p>

<p>“Tá agus níos mó,” ar san fear beag glas.</p>

<p>“Cuir i ḃfolaċ mé go maidin go n-imṫiġeann do

<p>Ṫug sé an faṫaċ leis, agus ċaiṫ sé faoi ḃeul daḃaiċ

<p>Air maidin, lá air na ṁáraċ, ṫug an fear gearr glas
mac ríġ Eireann agus a ṁuinntir amaċ as an g-caisleán
agus d’ḟág sé ag ceann an ḃóṫair iad, agus ṫáinig sé

Duḃairt an fear gearr glas muna ḃfáġaḋ

leis an ceann do ḃaint dé. Duḃairt an faṫaċ ann sin
go dtiúḃraḋ sé ḋó iad, agus ṫug. “Am air biṫ,” ar seisean,
“a ċuirfeas tu na slipeuraiḋ sin ort, agus ’haiġ

<p>D’imṫiġ mac ríġ Eireann agus an fear gearr glas,

go raiḃ an capall ag dul faoi sgáṫ na copóige agus ní

agus duḃairt an fear gearr glas go mbeiḋeaḋ siad i

Ḍearc mac ríġ Eireann uaiḋ agus ni ḟacaiḋ sé dadaṁ.
Ḍearc an fear gearr glas uaiḋ agus ċonnairc sé
caisleán mór. D’ḟágḃaiġ sé mac ríġ Eireann agus a

Ṫáinig an faṫaċ amaċ agus duḃairt sé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> “moṫuiġim

<p>“Ní Éireannaċ binn breugaċ mise,” ar san fear

<p>Agus leis sin ṫosuiġ an fear gearr glas ag méaduġaḋ

<p>Ṫáinig faitċios air an ḃfaṫaċ, agus duḃairt sé, “ḃfuil

<p>“Tá,” ar san fear gearr glas, “agus níos mó.”</p>

<p>“O cuir mé a ḃfolaċ, cuir me i ḃfolaċ,” ar san faṫaċ,
“go n-ímṫiġeann do ṁáiġistir, agus rud air biṫ a ḃéiḋeas

<p>Ṫug sé an faṫaċ leis agus ċuir sé faoi ḃeul daḃaiċ é,

<p>Ṫáinig sé air ais agus ṫug sé mac ríġ Éireann, an
gunnaire, an cluasaire, an coisire, an séidire, agus

<p>Air maidin, lá air na ṁáraċ, ṫug sé mac ríġ Eireann
agus a ṁuinntir amaċ agus d’ḟágḃuiġ sé ag ceann an
ḃóṫair iad agus ṫáinig sé féin air ais, agus leig sé

Duḃairt an faṫaċ naċ dtiúḃraḋ sé an sean-ċloiḋeaṁ sin

<p>“Ní ġlacfaiḋ mé sin,” ar san fear gearr glas, “caiṫfiḋ

<p>“Is fearr dam a ṫaḃairt duit,” ar san faṫaċ, “agus
cia bé áit a ḃualfeas tu buille leis an g-cloiḋeaṁ sin

<p>Cuaiḋ mac ríġ Eireann agus an fear gearr glas, agus

<p>D’ ḟiafruiġ an ḃean de ṁac ríġ Eireann creud do

“má ḟuasglann tu mo ġeasa ḋíom.”</p>

<p>Fuair sé a lóistín le na ċuid buaċaill ann san

<p>Ċuir sí biorán-suain faoi na ċeann, agus ṫuit sé

Nuair ḃí sí imṫiġṫe ṫuit an ríġ niṁe ’nna ċodlaḋ
agus nuair a ḃí sé ’nna ċodlaḋ ṫáinig an fear gearr

<p>“Tá,” ar seisean.</p>

<p>Ḃí tri fíċe cloigionn na ndaoine a ṫáinig ’gá h-íarraiḋ

<p>An oiḋċe, an lá air na ṁáraċ, ṫáinig sí agus ṫug sí

sise an ċíar léiṫe. Ṫug sí an ċíar do’n ríġ niṁe agus
duḃairt sí leis gan an ċiar do ċailleaḋ mar ċaill sé an

<p>Nuair ṫáiniġ an ṁaidin, ḋúisiġ mac ríġ Eireann agus

Nuair ṫáinig sise ṫug sé an ċíar dí, agus ḃí iongantas

<p>Táinig sí an tríoṁaḋ oiḋċe, agus duḃairt sí le mac riġ
Eireann an ceann do cíaraḋ leis an g-cíair sin do ḃeiṫ

<p>Ḃí an biorán-suain faoi na ċeann, agus ṫuit sé
’nna ċodlaḋ. Ṫáinig sise agus ġoid sí an ċíar uaiḋ.
Ṫug sí do’n ríġ niṁe í, agus duḃairt sí leis nár ḟeud

Ṫug an riġ niṁe an ċiar leis, agus ċuir sé asteaċ í

<p>Nuair ṫáinig sise ag fiafruiġ an raiḃ an ċiar aige,
duḃairt sé go raiḃ, agus an ceann do cíaraḋ léiṫe, agus
ċaiṫ sé ceann an ríġ niṁe ċuici.</p>

<p>Nuair ċonnairc sí an cloigionn ḃí fearg ṁór uirri, agus
duḃairt sí leis naċ ḃfuiġfeaḋ sé í le pósaḋ go ḃfáġaḋ

<p>Fuair sí sean-ċailleaċ (ḃuitse éigin) agus ṫug sí trí

<h2>THE KING OF IRELAND’S SON.</h2>

<p>There was a king’s son in Ireland long ago, and he
went out and took with him his gun and his dog. There
was snow out. He killed a raven. The raven fell on
the snow. He never saw anything whiter than the snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
or blacker than the raven’s skull, or redder than its share
of blood,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that was a’pouring out.</p>

<p>He put himself under <i>gassa</i><a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and obligations of the
year, that he would not eat two meals at one table, or
sleep two nights in one house, until he should find a
woman whose hair was as black as the raven’s head, and
her skin as white as the snow, and her two cheeks as red
as the blood.</p>

<p>There was no woman in the world like that; but one
woman only, and she was in the eastern world.</p>

<p>The day on the morrow he set out, and money
was not plenty, but he took with him twenty pounds.
It was not far he went until he met a funeral, and
he said that it was as good for him to go three steps
with the corpse. He had not the three steps walked
until there came a man and left his writ down on the
corpse for five pounds. There was a law in Ireland at
that time that any man who had a debt upon another
person (<i>i.e.</i>, to whom another person owed a debt) that
person’s people could not bury him, should he be dead,
without paying his debts, or without the leave of the
person to whom the dead man owed the debts. When
the king of Ireland’s son saw the sons and daughters
of the dead crying, and they without money to give
the man, he said to himself: “It’s a great pity that
these poor people have not the money,” and he put his
hand in his pocket and paid the five pounds himself for
the corpse. After that, he said he would go as far as
the church to see it buried. Then there came another
man, and left his writ on the body for five pounds more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
“As I gave the first five pounds,” said the king of Erin’s
son to himself, “it’s as good for me to give the other
five, and to let the poor man go to the grave.” He paid
the other five pounds. He had only ten pounds then.</p>

<p>Not far did he go until he met a short green man, and
he asked him where was he going. He said that he was
going looking for a woman in the eastern world. The
short green man asked him did he want a boy (servant),
and he said he did, and [asked] what would be the wages
he would be looking for? He said: “The first kiss of his
wife if he should get her.” The king of Ireland’s son said
that he must get that.</p>

<p>Not far did they go until they met another man and
his gun in his hand, and he a’levelling it at the blackbird
that was in the eastern world, that he might have it
for his dinner. The short green man said to him that
it was as good for him to take that man into his service if
he would go on service with him. The son of the king of
Ireland asked him if he would come on service with him.</p>

<p>“I will,” said the man, “if I get my wages.”</p>

<p>“And what is the wages you’ll be looking for?”</p>

<p>“The place of a house and garden.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get that if my journey succeeds with me.”</p>

<p>The king of Ireland’s son went forward with the short
green man and the gunner, and it was not far they went
until a man met them, and his ear left to the ground, and
he listening to the grass growing.</p>

<p>“It’s as good for you to take that man into your service,”
said the short green man.</p>

<p>The king’s son asked the man whether he would come
with him on service.</p>

<p>“I’ll come if I get the place of a house and garden.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>“You will get that from me if the thing I have in my
head succeeds with me.”</p>

<p>The son of the king of Ireland, the short green man,
the gunman, and the earman, went forward, and it was
not far they went until they met another man, and his
one foot on his shoulder, and he keeping a field of hares,
without letting one hare in or out of the field. There
was wonder on the king’s son, and he asked him “What
was the sense of his having one foot on his shoulder like
that.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says he, “if I had my two feet on the ground
I should be so swift that I would go out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Will you come on service with me?” said the king’s
son.</p>

<p>“I’ll come if I get the place of a house and garden.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get that if the thing I have in my head succeeds
with me.”</p>

<p>The son of the king of Ireland, the short green man, the
gunman, the earman, and the footman, went forward, and
it was not far they went till they came to a man and he
turning round a wind-mill with one nostril, and his finger
left on his nose shutting the other nostril.</p>

<p>“Why have you your finger on your nose?” said the
king of Ireland’s son.</p>

<p>“Oh,” says he, “if I were to blow with the two nostrils
I would sweep the mill altogether out of that up into the
air.”</p>

<p>“Will you come on hire with me?”</p>

<p>“I will if I get the place of a house and garden.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get that if the thing I have in my head succeeds
with me.”</p>

<p>The son of the king of Ireland, the short green man,
the gunman, the earman, the footman, and the blowman
went forward until they came to a man who was
sitting on the side of the road and he a’breaking stones
with one thigh, and he had no hammer or anything else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The king’s son asked him why it was he was breaking
stones with his half (<i>i.e.</i>, one) thigh.</p>

<p>“Oh,” says he, “if I were to strike them with the double
thigh I’d make powder of them.”</p>

<p>“Will you hire with me?”</p>

<p>“I will if I get the place of a house and garden.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get that if the thing I have in my head succeeds
with me.”</p>

<p>Then they all went forward together—the son of the
king of Ireland, the short green man, the gunman, the
earman, the footman, the blowman, and the man that
broke stones with the side of his thigh, and they would
overtake the March wind that was before them, and the
March wind that was behind them would not overtake
them, until the evening came and the end of the day.</p>

<p>The king of Ireland’s son looked from him, and he
did not see any house in which he might be that night.
The short green man looked from him, and he saw a
house, and there was not the top of a quill outside of it,
nor the bottom of a quill inside of it, but only one quill
alone, which was keeping shelter and protection on it.
The king’s son said that he did not know where he should
pass that night, and the short green man said that they
would be in the house of the giant over there that night.</p>

<p>They came to the house, and the short green man drew
the <i>coolaya-coric</i> (pole of combat), and he did not leave
child with woman, foal with mare, pigeen with pig, or
badger in glen, that he did not turn over three times with
the quantity of sound he knocked out of the <i>coolaya-coric</i>.
The giant came out, and he said: “I feel the smell of the
melodious lying Irishman under (<i>i.e.</i>, in) my little sod of
country.”</p>

<p>“I’m no melodious lying Irishman,” said the short
green man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> “but my master is out there at the head of
the avenue, and if he comes he will whip the head off
you.” The short green man was growing big, growing
big, until at last he looked as big as the castle. There
came fear on the giant, and he said: “Is your master as
big as you?”</p>

<p>“He is,” says the short green man, “and bigger.”</p>

<p>“Put me in hiding till morning, until your master goes,”
said the giant.</p>

<p>Then he put the giant under lock and key, and went
out to the king’s son. Then the king of Ireland’s son,
the gunman, the earman, the footman, the blowman, and
the man who broke stones with the side of his thigh,
came into the castle, and they spent that night, a third
of it a’story-telling, a third of it with Fenian tales,
and a third of it in mild enjoyment(?) of slumber and
of true sleep.</p>

<p>When the day on the morrow arose, the short green
man brought with him his master, the gunman, the
earman, the footman, the blowman, and the man who
broke stones with the side of his thigh, and he left them
outside at the head of the avenue, and he came back
himself and took the lock off the giant. He told the
giant that his master sent him back for the black cap
that was under the head of his bed. The giant said that
he would give him a hat that he never wore himself, but
that he was ashamed to give him the old cap. The short
green man said that unless he gave him the cap his
master would come back and strike the head off him.</p>

<p>“It’s best for me to give it to you,” said the giant; “and
any time at all you will put it on your head you will see
everybody and nobody will see you.” He gave him the
cap then, and the short green man came and gave it to
the king of Ireland’s son.</p>

<p>They were a’going then. They would overtake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
March wind that was before them, and the March wind
that was behind them would not overtake them, going to
the eastern world. When evening and the end of the
day came, the king of Ireland’s son looked from him,
and he did not see any house in which he might be
that night. The short green man looked from him, and
he saw a castle, and he said: “The giant that is in
that castle is the brother of the giant with whom we
were last night, and we shall be in this castle to-night.”
They came to the castle, and he left the king’s son
and his people at the head of the avenue, and he went
to the door and pulled the <i>coolaya-coric</i>, and he did not
leave child with woman, foal with mare, pigeen with
pig, or badger in glen, within seven miles of him, that
he did not knock three turns out of them with all the
sound he knocked out of the <i>coolaya-coric</i>.</p>

<p>The giant came out, and he said, “I feel the smell of
a melodious lying Irishman under my sod of country.”</p>

<p>“No melodious lying Irishman am I,” says the short
green man; “but my master is outside at the head of
the avenue, and if he comes he will whip the head off
you.”</p>

<p>“I think you large of one mouthful, and I think you
small of two mouthfuls,” said the giant.</p>

<p>“You won’t get me of a mouthful at all,” said the
short green man, and he began swelling until he was
as big as the castle. There came fear on the giant, and
he said:</p>

<p>“Is your master as big as you?”</p>

<p>“He is, and bigger.”</p>

<p>“Hide me,” said the giant, “till morning, until your
master goes, and anything you will be wanting you must
get it.”</p>

<p>He brought the giant with him, and he put him under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the mouth of a <i>douac</i> (great vessel of some sort). He
went out and brought in the son of the king of Ireland,
the gunman, the earman, the footman, the blowman, and
the man who broke stones with the side of his thigh,
and they spent that night, one-third of it telling Fenian
stories, one-third telling tales, and one-third in the mild
enjoyment of slumber and of true sleep until morning.</p>

<p>In the morning, the day on the morrow, the short
green man brought the king’s son and his people out of
the castle, and left them at the head of the avenue, and
he went back himself and asked the giant for the old
slippers that were left under the head of his bed.</p>

<p>The giant said that he would give his master a pair of
boots as good as ever he wore; and what good was there
in the old slippers?</p>

<p>The short green man said that unless he got the slippers
he would go for his master to whip the head off him.</p>

<p>Then the giant said that he would give them to him,
and he gave them.</p>

<p>“Any time,” said he, “that you will put those slippers
on you, and say ‘high-over!’ any place you have a mind
to go to, you will be in it.”</p>

<p>The son of the king of Ireland, the short green man,
the gunman, the earman, the footman, the blowman,
and the man who broke stones with the side of his
thigh, went forward until evening came, and the end
of the day, until the horse would be going under the
shade of the docking, and the docking would not wait
for him. The king’s son asked the short green man
where should they be that night, and the short green
man said that they would be in the house of the brother
of the giant with whom they spent the night before.
The king’s son looked from him and he saw nothing.
The short green man looked from him and he saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
great castle. He left the king’s son and his people there,
and he went to the castle by himself, and he drew the
<i>coolaya-coric</i>, and he did not leave child with woman,
foal with mare, pigeen with pig, or badger in glen, but
he turned them over three times with all the sound he
struck out of the <i>coolaya-coric</i>. The giant came out, and
he said: “I feel the smell of a melodious lying Irishman
under my sod of country.”</p>

<p>“No melodious lying Irishman am I,” said the short
green man; “but my master is standing at the head of
the avenue, and if he comes he shall strike the head
off you.”</p>

<p>And with that the short green man began swelling
until he was the size of the castle at last. There came
fear on the giant, and he said: “Is your master as big
as yourself?”</p>

<p>“He is,” said the short green man, “and bigger.”</p>

<p>“Oh! put me in hiding; put me in hiding,” said the
giant, “until your master goes; and anything you will
be asking you must get it.”</p>

<p>He took the giant with him, and he put him under the
mouth of a <i>douac</i>, and a lock on him. He came back,
and he brought the king of Ireland’s son, the gunman,
the earman, the footman, the blowman, and the man
who broke stones with the side of his thigh, into the
castle with him, and they spent that night merrily—a
third of it with Fenian tales, a third of it with telling
stories, and a third of it with the mild enjoyment of
slumber and of true sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning, the day on the morrow, he brought
the son of the king of Ireland out, and his people with
him, and left them at the head of the avenue, and he
came back himself and loosed out the giant, and said
to him, that he must give him the rusty sword that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
under the corner of his bed. The giant said that he
would not give that old sword to anyone, but that he
would give him the sword of the three edges that never
left the leavings of a blow behind it, or if it did, it would
take it with the second blow.</p>

<p>“I won’t have that,” said the short green man, “I
must get the rusty sword; and if I don’t get that, I must
go for my master, and he shall strike the head off you.”</p>

<p>“It is better for me to give it to you,” said the giant,
“and whatever place you will strike a blow with that
sword, it will go to the sand (<i>i.e.</i>, cut to the earth)
though it were iron were before it.” Then he gave him
the rusty sword.</p>

<p>The son of the king of Ireland, the gunman, the earman,
the footman, the blowman, and the man who broke
stones with the side of his thigh, went forward after
that, until evening came, and the end of the day, until
the horse was going under the shade of the docking,
and the docking would not wait for him. The March
wind that was behind them would not overtake them,
and they would overtake the wind of March that was
before them, and they were that night (arrived) in the
eastern world, where was the lady.</p>

<p>The lady asked the king of Ireland’s son what it was he
wanted, and he said that he was looking for herself as
wife.</p>

<p>“You must get me,” said she, “if you loose my geasa<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
off me.”</p>

<p>He got lodging with all his servants in the castle
that evening, and in the night she came and said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
“Here is a scissors for you, and unless you have that
scissors for me to-morrow morning, the head will be
struck off you.”</p>

<p>She placed a pin of slumber under his head, and he
fell into his sleep, and as soon as he did, she came and
took the scissors from him and left him there. She
gave the scissors to the King of Poison,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and she desired
the king to have the scissors for her in the morning.
Then she went away. When she was gone the King of
Poison fell into his sleep; and when he was in his sleep
the short green man came, and the old slippers on him,
and the cap on his head, and the rusty sword in his
hand, and wherever it was the king had left the scissors
out of his hand, he found it. He gave it to the king of
Ireland’s son, and when she (the lady) came in the
morning, she asked; “Son of the king of Ireland, have
you the scissors?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said he.</p>

<p>There were three scores of skulls of the people that
went to look for her set on spikes round about the castle,
and she thought that she would have his head on a spike
along with them.</p>

<p>On the night of the next day she came and gave him
a comb, and said to him unless he had that comb for her
next morning when she would come, that the head
should be struck off him. She placed a pin of slumber
under his head, and he fell into his sleep as he fell the
night before, and she stole the comb with her. She gave
the comb to the King of Poison, and said to him not to
lose the comb as he lost the scissors. The short green
man came with the old slippers on his feet, the old cap
on his head, and the rusty sword in his hand; and the
king did not see him until he came behind him and took
away the comb with him.</p>

<p>When the king of Ireland’s son rose up the next
morning he began crying for the comb, which was gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
from him. “Don’t mind that,” said the short green man:
“I have it.” When she came he gave her the comb, and
there was wonder on her.</p>

<p>She came the third night, and said to the son of the
king of Ireland to have for her the head of him who
was combed with that comb, on the morrow morning.
“Now,” said she, “there was no fear of you until this
night; but if you lose it this time, your head is gone.”</p>

<p>The pin of slumber was under his head, and he fell into
his sleep. She came and stole the comb from him. She
gave it to the King of Poison, and she said to him that he
could not lose it unless the head should be struck off
himself. The King of Poison took the comb with him,
and he put it into a rock of stone and three score of locks
on it, and the king sat down himself outside of the locks
all, at the door of the rock, guarding it. The short
green man came, and the slippers and the cap on him,
and the rusty sword in his hand, and he struck a stroke
on the stone rock and he opened it up, and he struck the
second stroke on the King of Poison, and he struck the
head off him. He brought back with him then the
comb to the king’s son, and he found him awake, and
weeping after the comb. “There is your comb for you,”
said he; “she will come this now,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and she will ask you
have you the comb, and tell her that you have, and the
head that was combed with it, and throw her the skull.”</p>

<p>When she came asking if he had the comb, he said he
had, and the head that was combed with it, and he threw
her the head of the King of Poison.</p>

<p>When she saw the head there was great anger on her,
and she told him he never would get her to marry until
he got a footman (runner) to travel with her runner for
three bottles of the healing-balm out of the well of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
western world; and if her own runner should come back
more quickly than his runner, she said his head was
gone.</p>

<p>She got an old hag—some witch—and she gave her
three bottles. The short green man bade them give three
bottles to the man who was keeping the field of hares,
and they were given to him. The hag and the man
started, and three bottles with each of them; and the
runner of the king’s son was coming back half way on
the road home, while the hag had only gone half way to the
well. “Sit down,” said the hag to the foot-runner, when
they met, “and take your rest, for the pair of them are
married now, and don’t be breaking your heart running.”
She brought over a horse’s head and a slumber-pin in
it, and laid it under his head, and when he laid down his
head on it he fell asleep. She spilt out the water he had
and she went.</p>

<p>The short green man thought it long until they were
coming, and he said to the earman, “Lay your ear to
the ground and try are they coming.”</p>

<p>“I hear the hag a’coming,” said he; “but the footman
is in his sleep, and I hear him a’snoring.”</p>

<p>“Look from you,” said the short green man to the
gunman, “till you see where the foot-runner is.”</p>

<p>The gunman looked, and he said that the footman
was in such and such a place, and a horse’s skull under
his head, and he in his sleeping.</p>

<p>“Lay your gun to your eye,” said the short green man,
“and put the skull away from under his head.”</p>

<p>He put the gun to his eye and he swept the skull from
under his head. The footman woke up, and he found that
the bottles which he had were empty, and it was necessary
for him to return to the well again.</p>

<p>The hag was coming then, and the foot-runner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
not to be seen. Says the short green man to the man
who was sending round the windmill with his nostril:
“Rise up and try would you put back that hag.” He
put his finger to his nose, and when the hag was coming
he put a blast of wind under her that swept her back
again. She was coming again, and he did the same
thing to her. Every time she used to be coming near
them he would be sending her back with the wind he
would blow out of his nostril. At last he blew with the
two nostrils and swept the hag back to the western world
again. Then the foot-runner of the king of Ireland’s son
came, and that day was won.</p>

<p>There was great anger on the woman when she saw
that her own foot-runner did not arrive first, and she
said to the king’s son: “You won’t get me now till you
have walked three miles, without shoes or stockings, on
steel needles.” She had a road three miles long, and
sharp needles of steel shaken on it as thick as the grass,
and their points up. Said the short green man to the
man who broke stones with the side of his thigh: “Go
and blunt those.” That man went on them with one
thigh, and he made stumps of them. He went on them
with the double thigh, and he made powder and <i>prashuch</i>
of them. The king of Ireland’s son came and walked the
three miles, and then he had his wife gained.</p>

<p>The couple were married then, and the short green
man was to have the first kiss. The short green man
took the wife with him into a chamber, and he began on
her. She was full up of serpents, and the king’s son
would have been killed with them when he went to sleep,
but that the short green man picked them out of her.</p>

<p>He came then to the son of the king of Ireland, and
he told him: “You can go with your wife now. I am the
man who was in the coffin that day, for whom you paid
the ten pounds; and these people who are with you, they
are servants whom God has sent to you.”</p>

<p>The short green man and his people went away then,
and the king of Ireland’s son never saw them again.
He brought his wife home with him, and they spent a
happy life with one another.</p>

<p>Bhi scológ ṡaiḋḃir a g-Connaċtaiḃ aon uair aṁáin,
agus ḃí maoin go leór aige, agus bean ṁaiṫ agus muiríġin
ḃreáġ agus ní raiḃ dadaṁ ag cur buaiḋreaḋ ná trioblóide

sásta, agus go raiḃ an t-áḋ air, ċoṁ maiṫ agus
air ḋuine air biṫ a ḃí beó. Bhí sé mar sin gan ḃrón gan
ḃuaiḋreaḋ air feaḋ móráin bliaḋain i sláinte ṁaiṫ agus
gan tinneas ná aicíd air féin ná air a ċloinn, no go
dtáinig lá breáġ annsan ḃfóġṁar, a raiḃ sé dearcaḋ
air a ċuid daoine ag deunaṁ féir annsan moínḟeur a ḃí
a n-aice le na ṫeaċ féin, agus mar ḃí an lá ro ṫeiṫ d’ól

bainte, agus mar ḃí sé sáruiġṫe le teas an laé agus
leis an obair a ḃí sé ag deunaṁ, do ṫuit sé gan ṁoill

ceiṫre uair no go raiḃ an feur uile crapṫa agus go raiḃ
a ḋaoine oibre imṫiġṫe as an bpáirc.</p>

<p>Nuair ḋúisiġ sé ann sin, ṡuiḋ sé suas air a ṫóin, agus
ní raiḃ ḟios aige cia an áit a raiḃ sé, no gur ċuiṁniġ sé
faoi ḋeire gur annsan ḃpáirc air ċúl a ṫíge féin do ḃí sé

<p>“Cá raiḃ tu?” ars an inġean leis.</p>

<p>“Bhí mé mo ċodlaḋ,” ar seisean, “air an ḃfeur úr

<p>Chuaiḋ sé d’á leabuiḋ agus luiḋ sé síos agus ṫuit sé

D’éiriġ sé ann sin agus duḃairt a ḃean leis, “Creud do

<p>Chuaiḋ sé annsan g-cisteanaċ, n’áit a ḃí a inġean ag

<p>“Fuair mé codlaḋ maiṫ,” ar seisean, “aċt ní’l mé

ag riṫ anonn ’s anall ann mo ḃoilg o ṫaoiḃ go taoiḃ.”</p>

<p>“Ara ní féidir,” ar s an inġean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> “is slaiġdeán a fuair
tu ad’ luiġe amuiġ ané air an ḃfeur úr, agus muna

<p>Ṫáinig an traṫnóna, aċt ḃí an duine boċt annsan gcaoi
ċeudna, agus b’éigin dóiḃ fios ċur air an doċtúir. Bhí
sé ag ráḋ go raiḃ pian air, agus naċ raiḃ ḟios aige go
ceart cad é an áit ann a raiḃ an ṗian, agus nuair naċ

Bhí muinntir an tiġe ag deunaṁ uile ṡóirt d’ḟeud siad
ḋeunaṁ le meisneaċ a ċur ann.</p>

<p>Ṫáinig an doċtúir faoi ḋeire, agus d’ḟiafruiġ sé ḋé
creud do ḃí air, agus duḃairt seisean arís go raiḃ rud
éigin mar éinín ag léimniġ ann a ḃolg. Noċtuiġ an
doċtúir é agus rinne sé ḃreaṫnuġaḋ maiṫ air, aċt ní
ḟacaiḋ sé dadaṁ a ḃí as an m-bealaċ leis. Chuir sé a
ċluas le na ṫaoiḃ agus le na ḋruim, aċt níor ċualaiḋ
sé rud air biṫ ciḋ gó raiḃ an duine boċt é féin ag
ráḋ—“Anois! Nois! naċ g-cluinn tu é? Nois! naċ
ḃfuil tu ’g éisteaċt leis, ag léimniġ?” Aċt níor
ṫug an doċtúir rud aír biṫ faoi deara, agus ṡaoil
sé faoi ḋeire go raiḃ an fear as a ċéill, agus naċ raiḃ
dadaṁ air.</p>

<p>Duḃairt sé le mnaoi an tiġe nuair ṫáinig sé amaċ, naċ
raiḃ aon rud air a fear, aċt gur ċreid sé féin go raiḃ sé
tinn, agus go g-cuirfeaḋ sé druganna ċuige an lá
air na ṁáraċ a ḃéarfaḋ codlaḋ maiṫ ḋó, agus a ṡoċróċaḋ

boċt na druganna uile agus fuair sé codlaḋ mór arís
aċt nuair ḋúisiġ sé air maidin ḃí sé níos measa ’ná ’riaṁ,
aċt duḃairt sé nár ċualaiḋ sé an rud ag léimniġ taoḃ
astiġ ḋé anois.</p>

<p>Chuir siad fios air an doċtúir arís, agus ṫáinig se
aċt níor ḟeud sé rud air biṫ ḋeunaṁ. D’ḟág sé druganna
eile leis an ḃfear, agus duḃairt sé go dtiucfaḋ
sé arís i g-ceann seaċtṁuine eile le na ḟeicsint. Ní
ḃfuair an duine boċt fóiriġín air biṫ as ar ḟág an doċtúir

níos measa na roiṁe sin; aċt níor ḟeud sé aon rud ḋéanaṁ
agus ní raiḃ ḟios air biṫ aige cad é’n cineál tinnis

ar seisean, le mnaoi an tíġe, “mar naċ dtig liom

Tiucfaiḋ mé le na ḟeicsint ó am go h-am aċt ní ġlacfaiḋ

<p>Is air éigin d’ḟeud an ḃean an ḟearg do ḃí uirri do

sí muinntir an tiġe le ċéile agus ġlac siad cóṁairle,
“An doċtúir bradaċ sin,” ar sise, “ní fiú traiṫnín é.
Ḃfuil ḟios aguiḃ creud duḃairt sé? naċ nglacfaḋ sé

ní ṫiucfaiḋ sé ṫar an tairseaċ só go bráṫ. Raċfamaoid

minic, agus gaċ am a ṫáinig se do ḃí ainm eile aige níos
faide ’na a ċéile air a ṫinneas, ainmneaċa (anmanna)
nár ṫuig sé féin, ná duine air biṫ eile, aċt ḃí siad aige le
sgannruġaḋ na n-daoine.</p>

<p>D’ḟan siad mar sin air feaḋ ḋá ṁí, gan ḟios ag duine
air ḃiṫ creud do ḃí air an ḃfear ḃoċt, agus nuair naċ
raiḃ an doċtúir sin ag déanaṁ maiṫ air biṫ ḋó, fuair
siad doċtúir eile, agus ann sin doċtúir eile, no go saiḃ
uile ḋoċtúir a ḃí annsa’ g-condaé aca, saoi ḋeire, agus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ċaill siad a lán airgid leó, agus b’éigin dóiḃ cuid d’á
n-eallaċ ḋíol le h-airgiod ḟáġail le na n-íoc.</p>

<p>Bhí siad mar sin le leiṫ-ḃliaḋain ag congṁáil doċtuir
leis, agus na doċtúiriḋ ag taḃairt druganna ḋó, agus
an duine boċt a ḃí raṁar beaṫaiġṫe roiṁe sin, ag
éiriġe lom agus tana, go naċ raiḃ unsa feóla air, aċt
an croicion agus na cnáṁa aṁáin.</p>

<p>Bhí sé faoi ḋeire ċoṁ dona sin gur air éigin d’ḟeud sé
siúḃal, agus d’imṫiġ a ġoile uaiḋ, agus buḋ ṁór an
ṫriobloíd leis, greim aráin ḃuig, no deoċ bainne úir do
ṡlugaḋ agus ḃí uile ḋuine ag ráḋ go m-b’ḟearr dó bás
ḟáġail, agus buḋ ḃeag an t-iongnaḋ sin, mar naċ raiḃ
ann aċt mar ḃeiḋeaḋ sgáile i mbuideul.</p>

<p>Aon lá aṁáin, nuair ḃí sé ’nna ṡuiḋe air ċáṫaoir ag
doras an tiġe, ’gá ġrianuġaḋ féin ann san teas, agus
muinntir an tiġe uile imṫiġṫe amaċ, agus gan duine ann
aċt é féin, ṫáinig seanduine boċt a ḃí ag iarraiḋ déirce
o áit go h-áit suas ċum an dorais, agus d’aiṫniġ sé fear
an tiġe ’nna ṡuiḋe annsa’ g-cáṫaoir, aċt ḃí sé ċoṁ
h-aṫruiġṫe sin agus ċoṁ caiṫte sin gur air éigin d’aiṫneóċaḋ
duine é. “Tá mé ann só arís ag iarraiḋ déirce
ann ainm Dé,” ars an fear boċt, “aċt glóir do Ḍia
a ṁáiġistir creud do ḃain duit ní tusa an fear céudna
a ċonnairc mé leiṫ-ḃliaḋain ó ṡoin nuair ḃí mé ann só,
go ḃfóiriġ Dia ort.”</p>

<p>“Ara a Sheumais,” ar san fear tinn, “is mise naċ
ḃfeudfaḋ innsint duit creud do ḃain dam, aċt tá ḟios
agam air aon rud, naċ mḃéiḋ mé ḃfad air an t-saoġal
so.”</p>

<p>“Aċt tá brón orm d’ḟeicsint mar tá tu,” ar san déirceaċ,
“naċ dtig leat innsint dam cia an ċaoi ar ṫosuiġ
sé leat? creud a duḃairt na doċtúiriḋ?”</p>

<p>“Na doċtúiriḋ!” ar san fear tinn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> “mo ṁallaċt
orra! ní’l ḟios air dadaṁ aca, act ní ċóir dam ḃeiṫ ag
eascuine agus mise ċoṁ fogas sin dom’ ḃas, ’súf’ orra,
ni’l eólas air biṫ aca.”</p>

<p>“B’éidir,” ar san déirceaċ, “go ḃfeudfainn féin
biseaċ ṫaḃairt duit, dá n-inneósá ḋam creud atá ort.
Deir siad go mbíḋim eólaċ air aicídiḃ, agus air na
luiḃeannaiḃ atá maiṫ le na leiġeas.”</p>

<p>Rinne an fear tinn gáire. “Ní’l fear-leiġis ann sa’

aċt ní ḃfuair mé fóiriġin dá laġad ó ḋuine air biṫ aca,
aċt inneósaiḋ mé ḋuit-se mar d’éiriġ sé ḋam air dtús.”
Agus ann sin ṫug sé cúntas dó air uile ṗian a ṁoṫuiġ
sé, agus air uile rud a d’orduiġ na doċtúiriḋ.</p>

<p>D’éist an déirceaċ leis go cúramaċ, agus nuair ċríoċnuiġ
sé an sgeul uile, d’ḟiafruiġ sé ḋé, “cad é an sórt
páirce í air ar ṫuit tu do ċodlaḋ?”</p>

<p>“Is móinḟeur a ḃí ann,” ar san duine tinn, “aċt ḃí sé
go díreaċ bainte, ann san am sin.”</p>

<p>“Raiḃ sé fliuċ,” ars an déirceaċ.</p>

<p>“Ní raiḃ,” ar seisean.</p>

<p>“Raiḃ sroṫán uisge no caise a’ riṫ ṫríd?” ars an déirceaċ.</p>

<p>“Bhi,” ar seisean.</p>

<p>“An dtig liom an ṗáirc ḟeicsint?”</p>

<p>“Tig go deiṁin, agus taisbéunfaiḋ mé ḋuit anois é.”</p>

<p>D’éiriġ sé as a ċáṫaoir agus ċoṁ dona agus ḃí sé, stráċail
sé é féin air aġaiḋ, no go dtáinig sé ċum na h-áite
ann ar luiḋ sé ’nna ċodlaḋ an traṫnóna sin. Bhreaṫnuiġ
fear-na-déirce air an áit, tamall fada, agus ann
sin ċrom sé air an ḃfeur agus ċuaiḋ sé anonn ’s anall
agus a ċorp lúbṫa agus a ċeann cromṫa ag smeurṫaċt
ann sna luiḃeannaiḃ, agus ameasg an luiḃearnaiġ do ḃí
ag fás go tiuġ ann.</p>

<p>D’éiriġ sé faoi ḋeire, agus duḃairt sé, “Ta sé mar
ṡaoil mé,” agus ċrom sé é féin síos arís, agus ṫosuiġ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ag cuartuġaḋ mar roiṁe sin. Ṫóg sé a ċeann an dara
uair, agus ḃí luiḃ ḃeag ġlas ann a láiṁ. “An ḃfeiceann
tu sin,” ar sé, “áit air biṫ ann Éirínn a ḃfásann an luiḃ
seó ann, bíonn alp-luaċra anaice leis, agus ṡluig tu
alp-luaċra.”</p>

<p>“Cad é an ċaoi ḃfuil ḟios agad sin?” ars an duine
tinn, “dá mbuḋ mar sin do ḃí sé, is dóiġ go n-inneósaḋ
na doċtúiriḋ ḋam é roiṁe seo.”</p>

<p>“Go dtugaiḋ Dia ciall duit, na bac leis na doċtúiriḃ,”
ars an déirceaċ, “ni’l ionnta aċt eallta amadán. A

ag léimniġ ann do ḃolg an ċéad lá ’réis ṫu ḃeiṫ tinn.
B’é sin an alp-luaċra, agus mar do ḃí an áit sin ann
do ḃolg strainseuraċ leis i dtosaċ, ḃí sé mí-ṡuaiṁneaċ
innti, ag dul anonn ’s anall, aċt nuair ḃí sé cúpla lá innti,
ṡocruiġ sé é féin, agus fuair sé an áit compórtaṁail
agus sin é an t-áḋḃar fá ḃfuil tu ag congṁáil ċoṁ tana

<p>Níor ċreid an fear é, a dtosaċ, aċt lean an déirceaċ
dá ċóṁráḋ leis, ag cruṫuġaḋ ḋó, gur b’ é an ḟírinne a

agus ḃí siad réiḋ go leór le na ċreideaṁaint.</p>

<p>Níor ċreid an duine tinn, é féin, é, aċt ḃí siad uile ag
laḃairt leis, go ḃfuair siad buaiḋ air, faoí ḋeire; agus
ṫug sé cead dóiḃ trí doċtúiriḋe do ġlaoḋaċ asteaċ le
ċéile, go n-inneósaḋ se an sgeul nuaḋ so ḋóiḃ. Ṫáinig
an triúr le ċéile, agus nuair d’éist siad leis an méad
a ḃí an déirceaċ ag rád, agus le cóṁráḋ na mban,
rinne siad gáire agus duḃairt siad naċ raiḃ ionnta aċt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
amadáin uile go léir, agus gurb’é rud eile amaċ ’s amaċ

an t-am so, ḃí sé dá uair, ’s trí huaire níos faide ’ná

an rud a duḃairt na mná gur ṡluig sé an alp-luaċra.</p>

<p>Duḃairt an déirceaċ nuair ḃí siad imṫiġṫe. “Ní’l
iongantas air biṫ orm naċ ḃfuil tu fáġail beisiġ má’s
amadáin mar iad sin atá leat. Ní’l aon doċtúir ná
fear-leiġis i n-Éirinn anois a ḋéanfas aon ṁaiṫ ḋuit-se
aċt aon ḟear aṁáin, agus is sé sin Mac Diarmada,
Prionnsa Chúl-Ui-Ḃfinn air ḃruaċ loċa-Ui-Ġeaḋra
an doċtúir is fearr i g-Connaċtaiḃ ná ’sna cúig cúigiḃ.”
“Cá ḃfuil loċ-Ui-Ġeaḋra?” ars an duine tinn. “Shíos
i g-condaé Shligíġ; is loċ mór é, agus tá an Prionnsa
’nna ċóṁnuiḋe air a ḃruaċ,” ar sé, “agus má ġlacann
tu mo ċóṁairle-se raċfaiḋ tu ann, mar ’s é an ċaoi
ḋeireannaċ atá agad, agus buḋ ċóir duit-se, a ṁáiġistreas,”
ar sé ag tiontóḋ le mnaoi an tiġe, “do ċur iaċ

<p>“Maiseaḋ,” ars an ḃean, “ḋeunfainn rud air biṫ a
ṡlánóċaḋ é.”</p>

<p>“Mar sin, cuir go dti Prionnsa Chúil-Ui-Ḃfinn é,”
ar seisean.</p>

<p>“Dheunfainn féin rud air biṫ le mo ṡlánuġaḋ,” ars an
fear tinn, “mar tá’s agam naċ ḃfuil a ḃfad agam le
marṫain air an t-saoġal so, muna ndeuntar rud éigin
dam a ḃéarfas congnaṁ agus fóiríġin dam.”</p>

<p>“Mar sin, téiḋ go dtí an Prionnsa,” ar san déirceaċ.</p>

<p>“Rud air biṫ a ṁeasann tu go ndeunfaiḋ sé maiṫ ḋuit
buḋ ċóir ḋuit a ḋéanaṁ, a aṫair,” ars an inġean.</p>

<p>“Ní’l dadaṁ le déanaṁ maiṫ ḋó aċt dul go dtí an
Prionnsa,” ars an déirceaċ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Is mar sin ḃí siad ag árgúint agus ag cuiḃlint go dtí
an oiḋċe, agus fuair an déirceaċ leabuiḋ tuiġe annsa’
sgioból agus ṫosuiġ sé ag árgúint arís air maidin go
mbuḋ ċóir dul go dtí an Prionnsa, agus ḃí an ḃean agus
an inġean air aon ḟocal leis, agus fuair siad buaiḋ air
an ḃfear tinn, faoi ḋeire; agus duḃairt sé go raċfaḋ
sé, agus duḃairt an inġean go raċfaḋ sise leis, le
taḃairt aire ḋó, agus duḃairt an déirceaċ go raċfaḋ
seisean leó-san le taisbéant an ḃoṫair dóiḃ. “Agus
béiḋ mise,” ars an ḃean, “air ṗonc an ḃáis le h-imniḋe
ag fanaṁaint liḃ, go dtiucfaiḋ siḃ air ais.”</p>

<p>D’úġmuiġ siad an capall agus ċuir siad faoi an gcairt
é, agus ġlac siad lón seaċtṁuine leó, arán agus bagún
agus uiḃeaċa, agus d’imṫiġ siad leó. Níor ḟeud siad

agus ċuaiḋ siad air aġaiḋ arís air maidin, agus an
troṁaḋ lá annsan traṫnóna ṫáinig siad go h-áit-ċóṁnuiḋe
an Phrionnsa. Bhí teaċ deas aige air ḃruaċ an
loċa, le cúṁdaċ tuiġe air, ameasg na g-crann.</p>

<p>D’ḟág siad an capall agus an cairt i mbaile beag a
ḃí anaice le háit an Phrionnsa, agus ṡiúḃail siad uile le
ċéile go d-táinig siad ċum an tiġe. Chuaiḋ siad asteaċ
’san g-cisteanaċ agus d’ḟíaḟruiġ siad, “ar ḟeud siad an
Prionnsa d’ḟeicsint.” Duḃairt an searḃfóġanta go
raiḃ sé ag iṫe a ḃéile aċt go dtiucfaḋ sé, b’éidir, nuair
ḃeiḋeaḋ sé réiḋ.</p>

<p>Ṫáinig an Prionnsa féin asteaċ air an móimid sin
agus d’ḟiaḟruiġ sé ḋíoḃ creud do ḃí siad ag iarraiḋ.
D’éiriġ an fear tinn agus duḃairt sé leis gur ag iarraiḋ
conġnaṁ ó na onóir do ḃí sé, agus d’innis sé an sgeul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
uile dó. “’Nois an dtig le d’onóir aon ḟóiriġín ṫaḃairt
dam?” ar sé, nuair ċríoċnuiġ sé a sgéul.</p>

<p>“Tá súil agam go dtig liom,” ar san Prionnsa, “air
ṁóḋ air biṫ déanfaiḋ mé mo ḋíṫċioll air do ṡon, mar
ṫáinig tu ċoṁ fada sin le m’ḟeicsint-se. B’olc an ceart
dam gan mo ḋíṫċioll ḋeunaṁ. Tar suas annsa bpárlúis.
Is fíor an rud a duḃairt an sean duine atá ann sin
leat. Shluig tu alp-luaċra, no rud éigin eile. Tar
suas ’sa’ bpárlúis liom.”</p>

<p>Ṫug sé suas leis é, agus is é an béile a ḃí aige an lá
sin giota mór de ṁairtḟeóil ṡaillte. Ghearr sé greim
mór agus ċuir sé air ṗláta é, agus ṫug sé do’n duine
boċt le n-íṫe é.</p>

<p>“Óró! Créad atá d’ onóir ag déanaṁ ann sin anois,”
ars an duine boċt, “níor ṡluig mé oiread agus toirt uiḃe
d’ḟeóil air biṫ le ráiṫċe, ni’l aon ġoile agam, ní ṫig liom
dadaṁ iṫe.”</p>

<p>“Bí do ṫost a ḋuine,” ars an Prionnsa, “iṫ é sin
nuair a deirim leat é.”</p>

<p>D’iṫ an fear boċt an oiread agus d’ḟeud sé, aċt nuair
leig sé an sgian agus an ġaḃlóg as a láiṁ ċuir an
Prionnsa iaċ (d’ḟiaċaiḃ) air iad do ṫógḃáil arís, agus
do ṫosuġaḋ as an nuaḋ. Ċongḃuiġ sé ann sin é ag
iṫe, go raiḃ sé réiḋ le pleusgaḋ, agus níor ḟeud sé
faoi ḋeire aon ġreim eile ṡlugaḋ dá ḃfáġaḋ se ceud
púnta.</p>

<p>Nuair ċonnairc an Prionnsa naċ dtiucfaḋ leis tuilleaḋ
do ṡlugaḋ, ṫug sé amaċ as an teaċ é, agus duḃairt
sé leis an inġin agus leis an t-sean-déirceaċ iad do
leanaṁaint, agus rug sé an fear leis, amaċ go móinḟéur
breáġ glas do ḃí os coinne an tiġe, agus sróṫán beag
uisge ag riṫ tríd an móinḟeur.</p>

<p>Ṫug sé go bruaċ an t-sroṫáin é, agus duḃairt sé leis,
luiḋe síos air a ḃolg agus a ċeann ċongḃáil os cionn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
an uisge, agus a ḃeul d’ḟosgailt ċoṁ mór agus d’ḟeudfaḋ
sé, agus a ċongḃáil, beag-naċ, ag baint leis an uisge,
“agus fan ann sin go ciúin agus na corruiġ, air d’anam,”
ar sé, “go ḃfeicfiḋ tu creud éireóċas duit.”</p>

<p>Gheall an fear boċt go mbeiḋeaḋ sé socair, agus ṡín
sé a ċorp air an ḃfeur, agus ċongḃuiġ sé a ḃeul fosgailte
os cionn an t-sroṫáin uisge, agus d’ḟan sé ann
sin gan corruġaḋ.</p>

<p>Chuaiḋ an Prionnsa timċioll cúig slata air ais, air a
ċúl, agus ṫarraing sé an inġean agus an sean-ḟear leis,
agus is é an focal deireannaċ a duḃairt sé leis an
ḃfear tinn, “bí cinnte” ar sé, “agus air d’anam na
cuir cor asad, cia bé air biṫ rud éireóċas duit.”</p>

<p>Ni raiḃ an duine boċt ceaṫraṁaḋ uaire ’nna luiḋe mar
sin nuair ṫosuiġ rud éigin ag corruġaḋ taoḃ astiġ ḋé agus
ṁoṫaiġ sé rud éigin ag teaċt suas ann a sgornaċ, agus ag

Bhi an Prionnsa ag breaṫnuġaḋ go geur air, agus
ġlaoḋ sé amaċ, “na corruiġ fós,” mar ḃí an fear dul

<p>B’éigin do’n duine boċt a ḃeul ḟosgailt arís agus
d’ḟan sé an ċaoi ċeudna, agus ní raiḃ sé móimid ann, no
go dtáinig an dara rud suas ann a sgornaċ an ċaoi

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Chogair an Prionnsa, agus duḃairt sé “Nois tá ’n
tart ag teaċt orra, d’oibriġ an salann a ḃí ’sa’ mairtḟeóil
íad; nois tiucfaiḋ siad amaċ.” Agus sul do ḃí an focal
as a ḃeul ṫuit an tríoṁaḋ ceann le “plap” annsan

<p>“Sin duisín aca anois,” ar san Prionnsa, “Sin é an

<p>Bhí an fear ḃoċt dul ’g eíriġe arís, aċt ġlaoḋ an
Prionnsa air. “Fan mar a ḃfuil tu, níor ṫáinig an

<p>D’ḟan sé mar do ḃí sé, aċt níor ṫáinig aon ċeann eile
amaċ, agus d’ḟan sé níos mó ná ceaṫraṁaḋ uaire. Bhí
an Prionnsa féin ag éirige mí-ṡuaimneaċ, air eagla naċ

síos é gan ḃuiḋeaċas dó.</p>

<p>D’ḟan siad ceaṫraṁaḋ uaire eile, gan ḟocal do ráḋ,
agus i g-ceann an ama sin ṁoṫuiġ an duine boċt rud

<p>“’Ór! a ḃiṫeaṁnaiġ!” ar san Prionnsa, “cad ċuige

<h2>THE ALP-LUACHRA.</h2>

<p>There was once a wealthy farmer in Connacht, and he
had plenty of substance and a fine family, and there was
nothing putting grief nor trouble on him, and you would
say yourself that it’s he was the comfortable, satisfied
man, and that the luck was on him as well as on e’er a
man alive. He was that way, without mishap or misfortune,
for many years, in good health and without sickness
or sorrow on himself or his children, until there
came a fine day in the harvest, when he was looking at
his men making hay in the meadow that was near his
own house, and as the day was very hot he drank a
drink of buttermilk, and stretched himself back on the
fresh cut hay, and as he was tired with the heat of the
day and the work that he was doing, he soon fell asleep,
and he remained that way for three or four hours, until
the hay was all gathered in and his workpeople gone away
out of the field.</p>

<p>When he awoke then, he sat up, and he did not know
at first where he was, till he remembered at last that it
was in the field at the back of his own house he was
lying. He rose up then and returned to his house, and
he felt like a pain or a stitch in his side. He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
nothing of it, sat down at the fire and began warming
himself.</p>

<p>“Where were you?” says the daughter to him.</p>

<p>“I was asleep a while,” says he, “on the fresh grass
in the field where they were making hay.”</p>

<p>“What happened to you, then?” says she, “for you
don’t look well.”</p>

<p>“Muirya,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> musha, then,” says he, “I don’t know; but
it’s queer the feeling I have. I never was like it before;
but I’ll be better when I get a good sleep.”</p>

<p>He went to his bed, lay down, and fell asleep, and
never awoke until the sun was high. He rose up then
and his wife said to him: “What was on you that you
slept that long?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” says he.</p>

<p>He went down to the fire where the daughter was
making a cake for the breakfast, and she said to him:</p>

<p>“How are you to-day, father; are you anything
better?”</p>

<p>“I got a good sleep,” said he, “but I’m not a taste
better than I was last night; and indeed, if you’d believe
me, I think there’s something inside of me running back
and forwards.”</p>

<p>“Arrah, that can’t be,” says the daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> “but it’s a
cold you got and you lying out on the fresh grass; and
if you’re not better in the evening we’ll send for the
doctor.”</p>

<p>He was saying then that there was a pain on him, but
that he did not know rightly what place the pain was in.
He was in the same way in the evening, and they had
to send for the doctor, and when the doctor was not
coming quickly there was great fright on him. The
people of the house were doing all they could to put
courage in him.</p>

<p>The doctor came at last, and he asked what was on
him, and he said again that there was something like a
<i>birdeen</i> leaping in his stomach. The doctor stripped
him and examined him well, but saw nothing out of the
way with him. He put his ear to his side and to his
back, but he heard nothing, though the poor man himself
was calling out: “Now! now! don’t you hear it?
Now, aren’t you listening to it jumping?” But the
doctor could perceive nothing at all, and he thought at
last that the man was out of his senses, and that there
was nothing the matter with him.</p>

<p>He said to the woman of the house when he came out,
that there was nothing on her husband, but that he
believed himself to be sick, and that he would send her
medicine the next day for him, that would give him a
good sleep and settle the heat of his body. He did that,
and the poor man swallowed all the medicines and got
another great sleep, but when he awoke in the morning
he was worse than ever, but he said he did not hear the
thing jumping inside him any longer.</p>

<p>They sent for the doctor again, and he came; but he
was able to do nothing. He left other medicines with
them, and said he would come again at the end of a
week to see him. The poor man got no relief from all
that the doctor left with him, and when he came again
he found him to be worse than before; but he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
able to do anything, and he did not know what sort of
sickness was on him. “I won’t be taking your money
from you any more,” says he to the woman of the house,
“because I can do nothing in this case, and as I don’t
understand what’s on him, I won’t let on<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to be understanding
it. I’ll come to see him from time to time, but
I’ll take no money from you.”</p>

<p>The woman of the house could hardly keep in her
anger. Scarcely ever was the doctor gone till she
gathered the people of the house round her and they
took counsel. “That doctor <i>braduch</i>,” says she, “he’s
not worth a <i>traneen</i>; do you know what he said—that
he wouldn’t take any money from me any more, and he
said himself he knew nothing about anything; <i>suf</i> on
him, the <i>behoonuch</i>, he’ll cross this threshold no more;
we’ll go to the other doctor; if he’s farther from us, itself,
I don’t mind that, we must get him.” Everybody in the
house was on one word with her, and they sent for the
other doctor; but when he came he had no better knowledge
than the first one had, only that he had knowledge
enough to take their money. He came often to see the
sick man, and every time he would come he would have
every name longer than another to give his sickness;
names he did not understand himself, nor no one else,
but he had them to frighten the people.</p>

<p>They remained that way for two months, without anyone
knowing what was on the poor man; and when that
doctor was doing him no good they got another doctor,
and then another doctor, until there was not a doctor
in the county, at last, that they had not got, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
lost a power of money over them, and they had to sell
a portion of their cattle to get money to pay them.</p>

<p>They were that way for half a year, keeping doctors
with him, and the doctors giving him medicines, and the
poor man that was stout and well-fed before, getting
bare and thin, until at last there was not an ounce of
flesh on him, but the skin and the bones only.</p>

<p>He was so bad at last that it was scarcely he was able
to walk. His appetite went from him, and it was a
great trouble to him to swallow a piece of soft bread or
to drink a sup of new milk, and everyone was saying
that he was better to die, and that was no wonder, for
there was not in him but like a shadow in a bottle.</p>

<p>One day that he was sitting on a chair in the door of
the house, sunning himself in the heat, and the people
of the house all gone out but himself, there came up to
the door a poor old man that used to be asking alms
from place to place, and he recognised the man of the
house sitting in the chair, but he was so changed and so
worn that it was hardly he knew him. “I’m here again,
asking alms in the name of God,” said the poor man;
“but, glory be to God, master, what happened to you,
for you’re not the same man I saw when I was here half
a year ago; may God relieve you!”</p>

<p>“Arrah, Shamus,” said the sick man, “it’s I that can’t
tell you what happened to me; but I know one thing,
that I won’t be long in this world.”</p>

<p>“But I’m grieved to see you how you are,” said the
beggarman. “Tell me how it began with you, and what
the doctors say.”</p>

<p>“The doctors, is it?” says the sick man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> “my curse on
them; but I oughtn’t to be cursing and I so near the grave;
<i>suf</i> on them, they know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” says the beggarman, “I could find you a
relief myself, if you were to tell me what’s on you. They
say that I be knowledgable about diseases and the herbs
to cure them.”</p>

<p>The sick man smiled, and he said: “There isn’t a
medicine man in the county that I hadn’t in this house
with me, and isn’t half the cattle I had on the farm sold
to pay them. I never got a relief no matter how small,
from a man of them; but I’ll tell you how it happened to
me first.” Then he gave him an account of everything
he felt and of everything the doctors had ordered.</p>

<p>The beggarman listened to him carefully, and when he
had finished all his story, he asked him: “What sort of
field was it you fell asleep in?”</p>

<p>“A meadow that was in it that time,” says the sick
man; “but it was just after being cut.”</p>

<p>“Was it wet,” says the beggarman.</p>

<p>“It was not,” says he.</p>

<p>“Was there a little stream or a brook of water running
through it?” said the beggarman.</p>

<p>“There was,” says he.</p>

<p>“Can I see the field?”</p>

<p>“You can, indeed, and I’ll show it to you.”</p>

<p>He rose off his chair, and as bad as he was, he pulled
himself along until he came to the place where he lay
down to sleep that evening. The beggarman examined
the place for a long time, and then he stooped down
over the grass and went backwards and forwards with his
body bent, and his head down, groping among the herbs
and weeds that were growing thickly in it.</p>

<p>He rose at last and said: “It is as I thought,” and he
stooped himself down again and began searching as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
before. He raised his head a second time, and he had a
little green herb in his hand. “Do you see this?” said
he. “Any place in Ireland that this herb grows, there
be’s an alt-pluachra near it, and you have swallowed an
alt-pluachra.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” said the sick man. “If that
was so, sure the doctors would tell it to me before
now.”</p>

<p>“The doctors!” said the beggarman. “Ah! God give
you sense, sure they’re only a flock of <i>omadawns</i>. I tell
you again, and believe me, that it’s an alt-pluachra you
swallowed. Didn’t you say yourself that you felt something
leaping in your stomach the first day after you
being sick? That was the alt-pluachra; and as the place
he was in was strange to him at first, he was uneasy in
it, moving backwards and forwards, but when he was a
couple of days there, he settled himself, and he found the
place comfortable, and that’s the reason you’re keeping
so thin, for every bit you’re eating the alt-pluachra is
getting the good out of it, and you said yourself that one
side of you was swelled; that’s the place where the nasty
thing is living.”</p>

<p>The sick man would not believe him at first, but the
beggarman kept on talking and proving on him that
it was the truth he was saying, and when his wife and
daughter came back again to the house, the beggarman
told them the same things, and they were ready enough
to believe him.</p>

<p>The sick man put no faith in it himself, but they were
all talking to him about it until they prevailed on him
at last to call in three doctors together until he should tell
them this new story. The three came together, and when
they heard all the <i>boccuch</i> (beggarman) was saying, and
all the talk of the women, it is what they laughed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
said they were fools altogether, and that it was something
else entirely that was the matter with the man of
the house, and every name they had on his sickness this
time was twice—three times—as long as ever before.
They left the poor man a bottle or two to drink, and they
went away, and they humbugging the women for saying
that he had swallowed an alt-pluachra.</p>

<p>The boccuch said when they were gone away: “I
don’t wonder at all that you’re not getting better, if
it’s fools like those you have with you. There’s not a
doctor or a medicine-man in Ireland now that’ll do you
any good, but only one man, and that’s Mac Dermott
the Prince of Coolavin, on the brink of Lough Gara, the
best doctor in Connacht or the five provinces.”</p>

<p>“Where is Lough Gara?” said the poor man.</p>

<p>“Down in the County Sligo,” says he; “it’s a big
lake, and the prince is living on the brink of it; and if
you’ll take my advice you’ll go there, for it’s the last hope
you have; and you, Mistress,” said he, turning to the
woman of the house, “ought to make him go, if you
wish your man to be alive.”</p>

<p>“Musha!” says the woman, “I’d do anything that
would cure him.”</p>

<p>“If so, send him to the Prince of Coolavin,” says he.</p>

<p>“I’d do anything at all to cure myself,” says the sick
man, “for I know I haven’t long to live on this world
if I don’t get some relief, or without something to be
done for me.”</p>

<p>“Then go to the Prince of Coolavin,” says the beggarman.</p>

<p>“Anything that you think would do yourself good,
you ought to do it, father,” says the daughter.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing will do him good but to go to the
Prince of Coolavin,” said the beggarman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>So they were arguing and striving until the night
came, and the beggarman got a bed of straw in the
barn, and he began arguing again in the morning that
he ought to go to the prince, and the wife and daughter
were on one word with him; and they prevailed at last
on the sick man, and he said that he would go, and the
daughter said that she would go with him to take care
of him, and the boccuch said that he would go with them
to show them the road; “and I’ll be on the pinch of
death, for ye, with anxiety,” said the wife, “until ye
come back again.”</p>

<p>They harnessed the horse, and they put him under the
cart, and they took a week’s provision with them—bread,
and bacon, and eggs, and they went off. They could
not go very far the first day, for the sick man was so
weak, that he was not able to bear the shaking he was
getting in the cart; but he was better the second day,
and they all passed the night in a farmer’s house on
the side of the road, and they went on again in the
morning; but on the third day, in the evening, they
came to the dwelling of the prince. He had a nice
house, on the brink of the lake, with a straw roof, in
among the trees.</p>

<p>They left the horse and the cart in a little village near
the prince’s place, and they all walked together, until
they came to the house. They went into the kitchen,
and asked, “Couldn’t they see the prince?” The servant
said that he was eating his meal, but that he
would come, perhaps, when he was ready.</p>

<p>The prince himself came in at that moment, and asked
what it was they wanted. The sick man rose up and
told him, that it was looking for assistance from his
honour he was, and he told him his whole story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> “And
now can your honour help me?” he said, when he had
finished it.</p>

<p>“I hope I can,” said the prince; “anyhow, I’ll do
my best for you, as you came so far to see me. I’d
have a bad right not to do my best. Come up into the
parlour with me. The thing that old man told you is
true. You swallowed an alt-pluachra, or something else.
Come up to the parlour with me.”</p>

<p>He brought him up to the parlour with him, and it
happened that the meal he had that day was a big piece
of salted beef. He cut a large slice off it, and put it on
a plate, and gave it to the poor man to eat.</p>

<p>“Oro! what is your honour doing there?” says the
poor man; “I didn’t swallow as much as the size of an
egg of meat this quarter,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and I can’t eat anything.”</p>

<p>“Be silent, man,” says the prince; “eat that, when I
tell you.”</p>

<p>The poor man eat as much as he was able, but when
he left the knife and fork out of his hand, the prince
made him take them up again, and begin out of the new
(over again). He kept him there eating until he was
ready to burst, and at last he was not able to swallow
another bit, if he were to get a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>When the prince saw that he would not be able to
swallow any more, he brought him out of the house, and
he said to the daughter and the old beggarman to follow
them, and he brought the man out with him to a fine
green meadow that was forenent<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the house, and a
little stream of water running through it.</p>

<p>He brought him to the brink of the stream, and told
him to lie down on his stomach over the stream, and to
hold his face over the water, to open his mouth as wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
as he could, and to keep it nearly touching the water,
and “wait there quiet and easy,” says he; “and for
your life don’t stir, till you see what will happen to
you.”</p>

<p>The poor man promised that he would be quiet, and
he stretched his body on the grass, and held his mouth
open, over the stream of water, and remained there
without stirring.</p>

<p>The prince went backwards, about five yards, and
drew the daughter and the old man with him, and the
last word he said to the sick man was: “Be certain, and
for your life, don’t put a stir out of you, whatever thing
at all happens to you.”</p>

<p>The sick man was not lying like that more than a
quarter of an hour, when something began moving
inside of him, and he felt something coming up in his
throat, and going back again. It came up and went
back three or four times after other. At last it came to
the mouth, stood on the tip of his tongue, but frightened,
and ran back again. However, at the end of a little
space, it rose up a second time, and stood on his tongue,
and at last jumped down into the water. The prince
was observing him closely, and just as the man was
going to rise, he called out: “Don’t stir yet.”</p>

<p>The poor man had to open his mouth again, and he
waited the same way as before; and he was not there a
minute until the second one came up the same way as
the last, and went back and came up two or three
times, as if it got frightened; but at last, it also, like
the first one, came up to the mouth, stood on the tongue,
and when it felt the smell of the water below it, leaped
down into the little stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The prince said in a whisper: “Now the thirst’s
coming on them; the salt that was in the beef is
working them; now they’ll come out.” And before the
word had left his mouth, the third one fell, with a plop,
into the water; and a moment after that, another one
jumped down, and then another, until he counted five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.</p>

<p>“There’s a dozen of them now,” said the prince;
“that’s the clutch; the old mother didn’t come yet.”</p>

<p>The poor sick man was getting up again, but the
prince called to him: “Stay as you are; the mother
didn’t come up.”</p>

<p>He remained as he was, but no other one came out,
though he stayed there more than a quarter of an hour.
The prince himself was getting uneasy for fear the old
alt-pluachra might not stir at all. The poor man was so
tired and so weak that he wished to get up; and, in
spite of all the prince told him, he was trying to stand
on his feet, when the prince caught him by one leg,
and the boccuch by the other, and they held him down
in spite of him.</p>

<p>They remained another quarter of an hour without
speaking a word, or making a sound, and at the end of
that time the poor man felt something stirring again in
his side, but seven times worse than before; and it’s
scarcely he could keep himself from screeching. That
thing kept moving for a good while, and he thought the
side was being torn out of himself with it. Then it began
coming up, and it reached the mouth, and went back
again. At last it came up so far that the poor man
put the two fingers to his mouth and thought to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
hold of it. But if he put in his fingers quick, the old
alt-pluachra went back quicker.</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>behoonach</i>!” cried the prince, “what made
you do that? Didn’t I tell you not to let a stir out
of you? Remain quiet if she comes up again.”</p>

<p>They had to remain there for half an hour, because
the old mother of the alt-pluachras was scared, and she
was afraid to come out. But she came up at last, perhaps,
because there was too much thirst on her to let her
stand the smell of the water that was tempting her, or
perhaps she was lonesome after her children going from
her. Anyhow, she came up to his mouth, and stood there
while you would be counting about four score; and
when she saw nothing, and nothing frightened her, she
gave a jump down into the water, like her clutch before
her; and the plop of her into the water was seven times
heavier than theirs.</p>

<p>The prince and the other two had been watching the
whole, and they scarcely dared to breathe, for fear of
startling the horrid beast. As soon as ever she jumped
down into the water, they pulled back the man, and put
him standing again on his two feet.</p>

<p>He was for three hours before he could speak a word;
but the first thing he said was: “I’m a new man.”</p>

<p>The prince kept him in his own house for a fortnight,
and gave him great care and good feeding. He allowed
him to go then, and the daughter and the boccuch with
him; and he refused to take as much as a penny from
them.</p>

<p>“I’m better pleased than ten pounds on my own hand,”
said he, “that my cure turned out so well; and I’d be
long sorry to take a farthing from you; you lost plenty
with doctors before.”</p>

<p>They came home safely, and he became healthy and
fat. He was so thankful to the poor boccuch that he
kept him in his own house till his death. As long as he
was alive he never lay down on green grass again; and
another thing, if there was any sickness or ill-health on
him, it isn’t the doctors he used to call in to him.</p>

<p>That was small wonder!</p>

<h2 id="TALE_V">PÁIDÍN O’CEALLAIĠ AGUS AN EASÓĠ.</h2>

<p>A ḃfad ó ṡoin ḃí fear d’ar’ ḃ’ainm Páidín O’Ceallaiġ
’nna ċóṁnuiḋe i ngar do Ṫuaim i gcondaé na Gailliṁe.
Aon ṁaidin aṁáin d’éiriġ sé go moċ agus ní raiḃ ḟios aige
cia an t-am a ḃi sé, mar ḃí solas breáġ ó’n ngealaiġ.
Ḃí dúil aige le dul go h-aonaċ Ċáṫair-na-mart le storc
asail do ḋíol.</p>

<p>Ní raiḃ sé níos mó ’na trí ṁíle air an mbóṫar go dtáinig
dorċadas mór air, agus ṫosuiġ ciṫ trom ag tuitim. Ċonnairc
sé teaċ mór ameasg crann timċioll cúig ċeud slat
ó’n mbóṫar agus duḃairt sé leis féin, “raċfaiḋ mé ċum
an tíġe sin, go dtéiḋ an ciṫ ṫart.” Nuair ċuaiḋ sé ċum
an tíġe, ḃí an doras fosgailte, agus asteaċ leis. Ċonnairc
sé seomra mór air ṫaoiḃ a láiṁe ċlé, agus teine
ḃreáġ ’san ngráta. Ṡuiḋ sé síos air stol le cois an
ḃalla, agus níor ḃfada gur ṫosuiġ sé ag tuitim ’nna
ċodlaḋ, nuair ċonnairc sé easóg ṁór ag teaċt ċum na
teineaḋ agus leag si giniḋ air leic an teaġlaiġ agus
d’imṫiġ. Níor ḃfada go dtáinig sí air ais le giniḋ eile
agus leag air leic an teaġlaiġ é, agus d’imṫiġ. Ḃí sí
ag imṫeaċt agus ag teaċt go raiḃ cárnán mór giniḋ air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
an teaġlaċ. Aċt faoi ḋeireaḋ nuair d’imṫiġ sí d’éiriġ
Páidín, agus ċuir sé an méad óir a ḃí cruinniġṫe aici ann
a ṗóca, agus amaċ leis.</p>

<p>Ní raiḃ sé a ḃ-fad imṫiġṫe gur ċualaiḋ sé an easóg
ag teaċt ’nna ḋiaiġ agus í ag sgreadaoil ċoṁ h-árd le
píobaiḃ. Ċuaiḋ sí roiṁ Páidín air an mbóṫar agus í ag
lubarnuiġ anonn ’s anall agus ag iarraiḋ greim sgornaiġ
d’ḟáġail air. Ḃí maide maiṫ daraċ ag Páidín agus
ċongḃuiġ sé í uaiḋ go dtáinig beirt ḟear suas. Ḃí madaḋ
maiṫ ag fear aca, agus ruaig sé asteaċ i bpoll ’san
mballa í.</p>

<p>Cuaiḋ Páidín ċum an aonaiġ, agus ann áit é ḃeiṫ tíġeaċt
a ḃaile leis an airgiod a fuair sé air a ṡean-asal,
mar ṡaoil sé air maidin go mbeiḋeaḋ sé ag deanaṁ,
ċeannuiġ sé capall le cuid de’n airgiod a ḃain sé de’n
easóig, agus ṫáinig sé a ḃaile agus é ag marcuiġeaċt.
Nuair ṫáinig sé ċoṁ fada leis an áit ar ċuir an madaḋ an
easóg ann san bpoll, ṫáinig sí amaċ roiṁe, ṫug léim suas,
agus fuair greim sgornaiġ air an g-capall. Ṫosuiġ an
capall ag riṫ, agus níor ḟeud Páidín a ċeapaḋ, no go
dtug sé léim asteaċ i g-clais ṁóir a ḃí líonta d’uisge
agus de ṁúlaċ. Ḃí sé ’gá ḃáṫaḋ agus ’gá ṫaċtaḋ go
luaṫ, go dtáinig fir suas a ḃí teaċt as Gailliṁ agus
ḋíḃir siad an easóg.</p>

<p>Ṫug Páidín an capall a ḃaile leis, agus ċuir sé asteaċ
i dteaċ na mbó é, agus ṫuit sé ’nna ċodlaḋ.</p>

<p>Air maidin, lá air na ṁáraċ, d’éiriġ Páidín go moċ, agus
ċuaiḋ sé amaċ le uisge agus féar ṫaḃairt do’n capall.
Nuair ċuaiḋ sé amaċ ċonnairc sé an easóg ag teaċt
amaċ as teaċ na mbó, agus í foluiġṫe le fuil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> “Mo
ṡeaċt míle mallaċt ort,” ar Páidín, “tá faitċios orm
go ḃfuil anaċain déanta agad.” Cuaiḋ sé asteaċ, agus
fuair sé an capall, péire bó-bainne, agus dá laoġ marḃ
Ṫáinig sé amaċ agus ċuir sé madaḋ a ḃí aige anḋiaiġ na
h-easóige. Fuair an madaḋ greim uirri agus fuair
sise greim air an madaḋ. Buḋ madaḋ maiṫ é, aċt
b’éigin dó a ġreim sgaoileaḋ sul ṫáinig Páidín suas; aċt
ċongḃuiġ sé a ṡúil uirri go ḃfacaiḋ sé í ag dul asteaċ i
mboṫán beag a ḃí air ḃruaċ loċa. Ṫáinig Páidín ag
riṫ, agus nuair ḃí sé ag an mboṫáinín beag ṫug sé craṫaḋ
do’n ṁadaḋ agus ċuir sé fearg air, agus ċuir sé
asteaċ roiṁe é. Nuair ċuaiḋ an madaḋ asteaċ ṫosuiġ
sé ag taṫfant. Ċuaiḋ Páidín asteaċ agus ċonnairc sé
sean-ċailleaċ ann san g-coirnéul. D’ḟiafruiġ sé ḋí an
ḃfacaiḋ sí easóg ag teaċt asteaċ.</p>

<p>“Ní ḟacaiḋ mé,” ar san ċailleaċ, “tá mé breóiḋte le
galar millteaċ agus muna dtéiḋ tu amaċ go tapa glacfaiḋ
tu uaim é.”</p>

<p>Coṁ fad agus ḃí Páidín agus an ċailleaċ, ag caint, ḃí
an madaḋ ag teannaḋ asteaċ, no go dtug sé léim suas
faoi ḋeireaḋ, agus rug sé greim sgornaiġ air an g-cailliġ.</p>

<p>Sgreaḋ sise, agus duḃairt, “tóg díom do ṁadaḋ a
Páidín Ui Ċeallaiġ, agus deunfaiḋ mé fear saiḋḃir
díot.”</p>

<p>Chuir Páidín iaċ (d’ḟiaċaiḃ) air an madaḋ a ġreim
sgaoileaḋ, agus duḃairt sé, “Innis dam cia ṫu, no cad
fáṫ ar ṁarḃ tu mo ċapall agus mo ḃa?”</p>

<p>“Agus cad fáṫ dtug tusa leat an t-ór a raiḃ mé cúig
ċeud ḃliaḋain ’gá ċruinniuġaḋ ameasg cnoc agus gleann
an doṁain.”</p>

<p>“Ṡaoil mé gur easóg a ḃí ionnad,” ar Páidín,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> “no ni
ḃainfinn le do ċuid óir; agus niḋ eile, má tá tu cúig
ċeud bliaḋain air an tsaoġal so tá sé i n-am duit imṫeaċt

<p>“Rinne mé coir ṁór i m’óige, agus táim le ḃeiṫ sgaoilte
óm’ ḟulaing má ṫig leat fiċe púnta íoc air son ceud agus
trí fiċid aifrionn dam.”</p>

<p>“Cá ḃfuil an t-airgiod?” ar Páidín.</p>

<p>“Éiriġ agus róṁar faoi sgeiċ atá os cionn tobair
ḃig i g-coirneul na páirce sin amuiġ, agus geoḃaiḋ tu
pota líonta d’ór. Íoc an fiċe púnta air son na n-aifrionn

<p>“Cad é an t-ainm atá ort?” ar Páidín.</p>

<p>“Máire ni Ciarḃáin,” ar san ċailleaċ.</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ Páidín a ḃaile agus nuair ṫáinig dorċadas na
h-oiḋċe ṫug sé láiḋe leis agus ċuaiḋ sé ċum na sgeiċe a
ḃí i g-coirneul na páirce agus ṫosuiġ sé ag róṁar. Níor
ḃfada go ḃfuair sé an pota agus nuair ḃain sé an leac
dé léim an madaḋ mór duḃ amaċ, agus as go bráṫ leis,
agus madaḋ Ṗáidin ’nn a ḋiaiġ.</p>

<p>Ṫug Páidín an t-ór a ḃaile agus ċuir sé i ḃfolaċ i
dteaċ na mbó é. Timċioll mí ’nna ḋiaiġ sin, ċuaiḋ sé go
h-aonaċ i nGailliṁ agus ċeannuiġ sé péire bó, capall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
agus duisín caora. Ní raiḃ ḟios ag na cóṁarsannaiḃ
cia an áit a ḃfuair sé an t-airgiod. Duḃairt cuid aca
go raiḃ roinn aige leis na daoniḃ maiṫe.</p>

<p>Aon lá aṁáin ġleus Páidín é féin agus ċuaiḋ sé ċum
an duine-uasail ar leis an teaċ mór, agus d’ iarr air,
an teaċ agus an talaṁ do ḃí ’nna ṫimcioll, do ḋíol leis.</p>

<p>“Tig leat an teaċ ḃeiṫ agad gan ċíos, aċt ta taiḋḃse
ann, agus níor ṁaiṫ liom ṫu dul do ċóṁnuiḋe ann, gan a
innsint, aċt ní sgarfainn leis an talaṁ gan ceud púnta
níos mó ’ná tá agad-sa le tairgsint dam.”</p>

<p>“B’éidir go ḃfuil an oiread agam-sa ’s atá agad
féin,” ar Páidín, “béiḋ mé ann so amáraċ leis an airgiod
má tá tusa réiḋ le seilḃ do ṫaḃairt dam.”</p>

<p>“Béiḋ mé réiḋ,” ar san duine-uasal.</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ Páidín aḃaile agus d’innis d’á ṁnaoi go raiḃ
teaċ mór agus gaḃáltas talṁan ceannuiġṫe aige.</p>

<p>“Cia an áit a ḃfuair tu an t-airgiod?” ar san ḃean.</p>

<p>“Naċ cuma ḋuit?” ar Páidín.</p>

<p>Lá air na ṁáraċ, ċuaiḋ Páidín ċum an duine-uasail, ṫug
ceud púnta ḋó, agus fuair seilḃ an tiġe agus an talṁan,
agus d’ḟág an duine-uasal an truscán aige asteaċ leis
an margaḋ.</p>

<p>D’ḟan Páidín ann san teaċ an oiḋċe sin, agus nuair
ṫáinig an dorċadas ċuaiḋ sé síos ann san tsoiléar, agus
ċonnairc sé fear beag le na ḋá ċois sgarṫa air ḃáirille.</p>

<p>“’Niḋ Dia ḋuit, a ḋuine ċóir,” ar san fear beag.</p>

<p>“Go mbuḋ h-é ḋuit,” ar Páidín.</p>

<p>“Ná bíoḋ aon ḟaitċios ort róṁam-sa,” ar san fear
beag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> “béid mé mo ċaraid maiṫ ḋuit-se má tá tu ionnán
run do ċongḃáil.”</p>

<p>“Táim go deiṁin. Ċongḃuiġ mé rún do ṁátar, agus
congḃóċaiḋ mé do rún-sa mar an g-ceudna.”</p>

<p>“B’éidir go ḃfuil tart ort,” ar san fear ḃeag.</p>

<p>“Ní’l mé saor uaíḋ,” air Páidín.</p>

<p>Ċuir an fear beag láṁ ann a ḃrollaċ, agus ṫarraing
sé corn óir amaċ, agus ṫug do Páidín é, agus duḃairt
leis, “tarraing fíon as an mbáirille sin fúm.”</p>

<p>Ṫarraing Páidín lán coirn agus ṡeaċaid do’n ḟear
beag é. “Ól, ṫu féin, i dtosaċ,” ar seisean. D’ól
Páidín, ṫarraing corn eile agus ṫug dón ḟear beag é,
agus d’ól sé é.</p>

<p>“Líon suas agus ól arís,” ar san fear beag, “is mian
liom-sa ḃeiṫ go súgaċ anoċt.”</p>

<p>Ḃí an ḃeirt ag ól gó raḃadar leaṫ air meisge. Ann
sin ṫug an fear beag léim anuas air an urlár, agus
duḃairt le Páidín, “naċ ḃfuil dúil agad i g-ceól?”</p>

<p>“Tá go deiṁin,” ar Páidín, “agus is maiṫ an daṁsóir
mé.”</p>

<p>“Tóg suas an leac ṁór atá ’san g-coirneul úd, agus
geoḃaiḋ tu mo ṗíobaiḋ fúiṫi.”</p>

<p>Ṫóg Páidín an leac, fuair na píobaiḋ, agus ṫug do ’n
ḟear beag iad. D’ḟáisg sé na píobaiḋ air, agus ṫosuiġ
sé ag seinm ceóil ḃinn. Ṫosuiġ Páidín ag daṁsa go raiḃ
sé tuirseaċ. Ann sin bí deoċ eile aca, agus duḃairt an
fear beag:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>“Deun mar duḃairt mo ṁáṫair leat, agus taisbéanfaiḋ
mise saiḋḃreas mór duit. Tig leat do ḃean ṫaḃairt
ann so, aċt ná h-innis dí go ḃfuil mise ann, agus
ní ḟeicfiḋ fí mé. Am air biṫ a ḃéiḋeas lionn nó fíon ag
teastáil uait tar ann so agus tarraing é. Slán leat
anois, agus téiḋ ann do ċodlaḋ, agus tar ċugam-sa an
oiḋċe amáraċ.”</p>

<p>Cuaiḋ Páidín ’nna leabuiḋ, agus níor ḃfada go raiḃ
sé ’nna ċodlaḋ.</p>

<p>Air maidin, lá air na ṁáraċ, ċuaiḋ Páidín a ḃaile agus
ṫug a ḃean agus a ċlann go dtí an teaċ mór, agus ḃíodar
go sona. An oiḋċe sin ċuaiḋ Páidín síos ann san tsoiléar.
Ċuir an fear beag fáilte roiṁe, agus d’iarr air “raiḃ

<p>“Ní’l go ḃfáġ’ mé deoċ,” ar Páidín.</p>

<p>“Ól do ṡaiṫ,” ar san fear beag, “ní ḃéiḋ an ḃáirille
sin folaṁ fad do ḃeaṫa.”</p>

<p>D’ól Páidín lán an ċoirn agus ṫug deoċ do ’n ḟear
ḃeag; ann sin duḃairt an fear beag leis:</p>

<p>“Táim ag dul go Dún-na-síḋ anoċt, le ceól do ṡeinm

greann breáġ. Ḃéarfaiḋ mé capall duit naċ ḃfacaiḋ

<p>“Raċfad agus fáilte,” ar Páidín, “aċt cia an leis-sgeul

<p>“Téiḋ do ċodlaḋ léiṫe, agus ḃéarfaiḋ mise amaċ ó n-a

ċaoi ċeudna,” ar san fear beag.</p>

<p>“Táim úṁal,” ar Páidín, “béiḋ deoċ eile agam sul a

<h2>PAUDYEEN O’KELLY AND THE WEASEL.</h2>

<p>A long time ago there was once a man of the name of
Paudyeen O’Kelly, living near Tuam, in the county
Galway. He rose up one morning early, and he did not
know what time of day it was, for there was fine light
coming from the moon. He wanted to go to the fair
of Cauher-na-mart to sell a <i>sturk</i> of an ass that he
had.</p>

<p>He had not gone more than three miles of the road
when a great darkness came on, and a shower began
falling. He saw a large house among trees about five
hundred yards in from the road, and he said to himself
that he would go to that house till the shower would be
over. When he got to the house he found the door
open before him, and in with him. He saw a large
room to his left, and a fine fire in the grate. He sat
down on a stool that was beside the wall, and began
falling asleep, when he saw a big weasel coming to the
fire with something yellow in its mouth, which it dropped
on the hearth-stone, and then it went away. She soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
came back again with the same thing in her mouth, and
he saw that it was a guinea she had. She dropped it on
the hearth-stone, and went away again. She was coming
and going, until there was a great heap of guineas on the
hearth. But at last, when he got her gone, Paudyeen
rose up, thrust all the gold she had gathered into his
pockets, and out with him.</p>

<p>He was not gone far till he heard the weasel coming
after him, and she screeching as loud as a bag-pipes.
She went before Paudyeen and got on the road, and she
was twisting herself back and forwards, and trying
to get a hold of his throat. Paudyeen had a good oak
stick, and he kept her from him, until two men came up
who were going to the same fair, and one of them had a
good dog, and it routed the weasel into a hole in the
wall.</p>

<p>Paudyeen went to the fair, and instead of coming home
with the money he got for his old ass, as he thought
would be the way with him in the morning, he went and
bought a horse with some of the money he took from the
weasel, and he came home and he riding. When he
came to the place where the dog had routed the weasel
into the hole in the wall, she came out before him, gave
a leap up and caught the horse by the throat. The horse
made off, and Paudyeen could not stop him, till at last he
gave a leap into a big drain that was full up of water
and black mud, and he was drowning and choking as fast
as he could, until men who were coming from Galway
came up and banished the weasel.</p>

<p>Paudyeen brought the horse home with him, and put
him into the cows’ byre and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning, the day on the morrow, Paudyeen rose
up early and went out to give his horse hay and oats.
When he got to the door he saw the weasel coming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the byre and she covered with blood. “My seven
thousand curses on you,” said Paudyeen, “but I’m afraid
you’ve harm done.” He went in and found the horse, a
pair of milch cows, and two calves dead. He came out
and set a dog he had after the weasel. The dog got a
hold of her, and she got a hold of the dog. The dog was
a good one, but he was forced to loose his hold of her
before Paudyeen could come up. He kept his eye on
her, however, all through, until he saw her creeping into
a little hovel that was on the brink of a lake. Paudyeen
came running, and when he got to the little hut he gave
the dog a shake to rouse him up and put anger on him,
and then he sent him in before himself. When the dog
went in he began barking. Paudyeen went in after him,
and saw an old hag (cailleach) in the corner. He asked
her if she saw a weasel coming in there.</p>

<p>“I did not,” said she; “I’m all destroyed with a plague
of sickness, and if you don’t go out quick you’ll catch
it from me.”</p>

<p>While Paudyeen and the hag were talking, the dog kept
moving in all the time, till at last he gave a leap up and
caught the hag by the throat. She screeched, and said:</p>

<p>“Paddy Kelly, take off your dog, and I’ll make you a
rich man.”</p>

<p>Paudyeen made the dog loose his hold, and said:
“Tell me who are you, or why did you kill my horse and
my cows?”</p>

<p>“And why did you bring away my gold that I was for
five hundred years gathering throughout the hills and
hollows of the world?”</p>

<p>“I thought you were a weasel,” said Paudyeen, “or
I wouldn’t touch your gold; and another thing,” says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he, “if you’re for five hundred years in this world, it’s
time for you to go to rest now.”</p>

<p>“I committed a great crime in my youth,” said the
hag, “and now I am to be released from my sufferings
if you can pay twenty pounds for a hundred and three
score masses for me.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” says Paudyeen.</p>

<p>“Go and dig under a bush that’s over a little well
in the corner of that field there without, and you’ll get
a pot filled with gold. Pay the twenty pounds for the
masses, and yourself shall have the rest. When you’ll
lift the flag off the pot, you’ll see a big black dog coming
out; but don’t be afraid before him; he is a son of mine.
When you get the gold, buy the house in which you saw
me at first. You’ll get it cheap, for it has the name of there
being a ghost in it. My son will be down in the cellar.
He’ll do you no harm, but he’ll be a good friend to you.
I shall be dead a month from this day, and when you get
me dead put a coal under this little hut and burn it.
Don’t tell a living soul anything about me—and the luck
will be on you.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” said Paudyeen.</p>

<p>“Maurya nee Keerwaun” (Mary Kerwan), said the
hag.</p>

<p>Paudyeen went home, and when the darkness of the
night came on he took with him a loy,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and went to the
bush that was in the corner of the field, and began
digging. It was not long till he found the pot, and
when he took the flag off it a big black dog leaped out,
and off and away with him, and Paudyeen’s dog after
him.</p>

<p>Paudyeen brought home the gold, and hid it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cow-house. About a month after that he went to the fair
of Galway, and bought a pair of cows, a horse, and a
dozen sheep. The neighbours did not know where he was
getting all the money; they said that he had a share with
the good people.</p>

<p>One day Paudyeen dressed himself, and went to the
gentleman who owned the large house where he first saw
the weasel, and asked to buy the house of him, and the
land that was round about.</p>

<p>“You can have the house without paying any rent at
all; but there is a ghost in it, and I wouldn’t like you to
go to live in it without my telling you, but I couldn’t part
with the land without getting a hundred pounds more
than you have to offer me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have as much as you have yourself,” said
Paudyeen. “I’ll be here to-morrow with the money, if
you’re ready to give me possession.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready,” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>Paudyeen went home and told his wife that he had
bought a large house and a holding of land.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the money?” says the wife.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it all one to you where I got it?” says
Paudyeen.</p>

<p>The day on the morrow Paudyeen went to the gentleman,
gave him the money, and got possession of the
house and land; and the gentleman left him the furniture
and everything that was in the house, in with the
bargain.</p>

<p>Paudyeen remained in the house that night, and when
darkness came he went down to the cellar, and he saw a
little man with his two legs spread on a barrel.</p>

<p>“God save you, honest man,” says he to Paudyeen.</p>

<p>“The same to you,” says Paudyeen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid of me at all,” says the little man.
“I’ll be a friend to you, if you are able to keep a secret.”</p>

<p>“I am able, indeed; I kept your mother’s secret, and I’ll
keep yours as well.”</p>

<p>“May-be you’re thirsty?” says the little man.</p>

<p>“I’m not free from it,” said Paudyeen.</p>

<p>The little man put a hand in his bosom and drew out a
gold goblet. He gave it to Paudyeen, and said: “Draw
wine out of that barrel under me.”</p>

<p>Paudyeen drew the full up of the goblet, and handed it
to the little man. “Drink yourself first,” says he.
Paudyeen drank, drew another goblet, and handed it to
the little man, and he drank it.</p>

<p>“Fill up and drink again,” said the little man. “I have
a mind to be merry to-night.”</p>

<p>The pair of them sat there drinking until they were half
drunk. Then the little man gave a leap down to the floor,
and said to Paudyeen:</p>

<p>“Don’t you like music?”</p>

<p>“I do, surely,” says Paudyeen, “and I’m a good dancer,
too.”</p>

<p>“Lift up the big flag over there in the corner, and you’ll
get my pipes under it.”</p>

<p>Paudyeen lifted the flag, got the pipes, and gave them
to the little man. He squeezed the pipes on him, and
began playing melodious music. Paudyeen began dancing
till he was tired. Then they had another drink, and the
little man said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>“Do as my mother told you, and I’ll show you great
riches. You can bring your wife in here, but don’t tell
her that I’m there, and she won’t see me. Any time
at all that ale or wine are wanting, come here and draw.
Farewell now; go to sleep, and come again to me to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>Paudyeen went to bed, and it wasn’t long till he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day of the morrow, Paudyeen
went home, and brought his wife and children to the big
house, and they were comfortable. That night Paudyeen
went down to the cellar; the little man welcomed him
and asked him did he wish to dance?</p>

<p>“Not till I get a drink,” said Paudyeen.</p>

<p>“Drink your ’nough,” said the little man; “that barrel
will never be empty as long as you live.”</p>

<p>Paudyeen drank the full of the goblet, and gave a
drink to the little man. Then the little man said to
him:</p>

<p>“I am going to Doon-na-shee (the fortress of the
fairies) to-night, to play music for the good people, and if
you come with me you’ll see fine fun. I’ll give you a
horse that you never saw the like of him before.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, and welcome,” said Paudyeen; “but
what excuse will I make to my wife?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring you away from her side without her knowing
it, when you are both asleep together, and I’ll bring you
back to her the same way,” said the little man.</p>

<p>“I’m obedient,” says Paudyeen; “we’ll have another
drink before I leave you.”</p>

<p>He drank drink after drink, till he was half drunk, and
he went to bed with his wife.</p>

<p>When he awoke he found himself riding on a besom
near Doon-na-shee, and the little man riding on another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
besom by his side. When they came as far as the green
hill of the Doon, the little man said a couple of words
that Paudyeen did not understand. The green hill
opened, and the pair went into a fine chamber.</p>

<p>Paudyeen never saw before a gathering like that which
was in the Doon. The whole place was full up of little
people, men and women, young and old. They all welcomed
little Donal—that was the name of the piper—and
Paudyeen O’Kelly. The king and queen of the fairies
came up to them, and said:</p>

<p>“We are all going on a visit to-night to Cnoc Matha,
to the high king and queen of our people.”</p>

<p>They all rose up then and went out. There were
horses ready for each one of them and the <i>coash-t’ya bower</i>
for the king and the queen. The king and queen got into
the coach, each man leaped on his own horse, and be
certain that Paudyeen was not behind. The piper went
out before them and began playing them music, and then
off and away with them. It was not long till they came
to Cnoc Matha. The hill opened and the king of the
fairy host passed in.</p>

<p>Finvara and Nuala were there, the arch-king and queen
of the fairy host of Connacht, and thousands of little
persons. Finvara came up and said:</p>

<p>“We are going to play a hurling match to-night against
the fairy host of Munster, and unless we beat them our
fame is gone for ever. The match is to be fought out on
Moytura, under Slieve Belgadaun.”</p>

<p>The Connacht host cried out: “We are all ready, and
we have no doubt but we’ll beat them.”</p>

<p>“Out with ye all,” cried the high king; “the men of the
hill of Nephin will be on the ground before us.”</p>

<p>They all went out, and little Donal and twelve pipers
more before them, playing melodious music. When they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
came to Moytura, the fairy host of Munster and the fairy
men of the hill of Nephin were there before them. Now,
it is necessary for the fairy host to have two live men
beside them when they are fighting or at a hurling-match,
and that was the reason that little Donal took Paddy
O’Kelly with him. There was a man they called the
“<i>Yellow Stongirya</i>,” with the fairy host of Munster, from
Ennis, in the County Clare.</p>

<p>It was not long till the two hosts took sides; the ball
was thrown up between them, and the fun began in
earnest. They were hurling away, and the pipers playing
music, until Paudyeen O’Kelly saw the host of Munster
getting the strong hand, and he began helping the fairy
host of Connacht. The <i>Stongirya</i> came up and he made
at Paudyeen O’Kelly, but Paudyeen turned him head over
heels. From hurling the two hosts began at fighting, but
it was not long until the host of Connacht beat the other
host. Then the host of Munster made flying beetles of
themselves, and they began eating every green thing that
they came up to. They were destroying the country
before them until they came as far as Cong. Then there
rose up thousands of doves out of the hole, and they
swallowed down the beetles. That hole has no other
name until this day but Pull-na-gullam, the dove’s
hole.</p>

<p>When the fairy host of Connacht won their battle, they
came back to Cnoc Matha joyous enough, and the king
Finvara gave Paudyeen O’Kelly a purse of gold, and the
little piper brought him home, and put him into bed
beside his wife, and left him sleeping there.</p>

<p>A month went by after that without anything worth
mentioning, until one night Paudyeen went down to the
cellar, and the little man said to him: “My mother is
dead; burn the house over her.”</p>

<p>“It is true for you,” said Paudyeen. “She told me that
she hadn’t but a month to be on the world, and the month
was up yesterday.”</p>

<p>On the morning of the next day Paudyeen went to the
hut and he found the hag dead. He put a coal under the
hut and burned it. He came home and told the little
man that the hut was burnt. The little man gave him a
purse and said to him; “This purse will never be empty
as long as you are alive. Now, you will never see me
more; but have a loving remembrance of the weasel.
She was the beginning and the prime cause of your
riches.” Then he went away and Paudyeen never saw
him again.</p>

<p>Paudyeen O’Kelly and his wife lived for years after this
in the large house, and when he died he left great wealth
behind him, and a large family to spend it.</p>

<p>There now is the story for you, from the first word to
the last, as I heard it from my grandmother.</p>

air a ḋruim agus ṫug asteaċ é. Ṫáinig buaċaill beag
eile amaċ, ċuir fáilte roiṁ Liam, ċuir sac air a ḋruim,
agus d’imṫiġ asteaċ leis. Ḃí buaċailliḋe ag teaċt, ag
cur fáilte roiṁ Liam, agus ag taḃairt sac leó, go raiḃ
an tonna cruiṫneaċta imṫiġṫe. Ann sin ṫáinig iomlán
na mbuaċaill i láṫair agus duḃairt Liam leó. “Tá
eólas agaiḃ uile orm-sa agus ní’l eólas agam-sa orraiḃse.”
Ann sin duḃradar leis, “téiḋ asteaċ, agus iṫ do
ḋínnéar, tá an máiġistir ag fanaṁaint leat.”</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ Liam asteaċ agus ṡuiḋ sé síos ag an mbord.
Níor iṫ sé an dara greim go dtáinig trom-ċodlaḋ air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
agus ṫuit sé faoi an mbord. Ann sin rinne an draoiḋ-eadóir
fear-bréige cosṁúil le Liam, agus ċuir a ḃaile
ċum mná Liaim é, leis an g-capall, agus leis an g-cairt.
Nuair ṫáinig sé go teaċ Liaim ċuaiḋ sé suas ann san
t-seomra, luiḋ air leabuiḋ, agus fuair bás.</p>

<p>Níor ḃfada go ndeacaiḋ an ġáir amaċ go raiḃ Liam
O Ruanaiġ marḃ. Ċuir an ḃean uisge síos agus nuair
ḃí sé teiṫ niġ sí an corp agus ċuir os cionn cláir é.
Ṫáinig na cóṁarsanna agus ċaoineadar go ḃrónaċ os
cionn an ċuirp, agus ḃí truaġ ṁór ann do’n ṁnaoi ḃoiċt
aċt ní raiḃ mórán bróin uirri féin, mar ḃí Liam aosta
agus í féin óg. An lá air na ṁáraċ cuireaḋ an corp
agus ní raiḃ aon ċuiṁne níos mó air Liam.</p>

<p>Ḃí buaċaill-aimsire ag mnaoi Liaim agus duḃairt sí
leis, “buḋ ċóir duit mé ṗósaḋ, agus áit Liaim ġlacaḋ.”</p>

<p>“Tá sé ró luaṫ fós, anḋiaiġ bás do ḃeiṫ ann san
teaċ,” ar san buaċaill, “fan go mbéiḋ Liam curṫa
seaċtṁain.”</p>

<p>Nuair ḃí Liam seaċt lá agus seaċt n-oiḋċe ’nna ċodlaḋ
ṫáinig buaċaill beag agus ḋúisiġ é. Ann sin duḃairt sé
leis, “táir seaċtṁain do ċodlaḋ. Ċuireamar do ċapall
agus do ċairt aḃaile. Seó ḋuit do ċuid airgid, agus
imṫiġ.”</p>

<p>Ṫáinig Liam a ḃaile, agus mar ḃí sé mall ’san oiḋċe ní
ḟacaiḋ aon duine é. Air maidin an laé sin ċuaiḋ bean
Liaim agus an buaċaill-aimsire ċum an t-sagairt agus
d’iarr siad air iad do ṗósaḋ.</p>

<p>“Ḃfuil an t-airgiod-pósta agaiḃ?” ar san sagart.</p>

<p>“Ní’l,” ar san ḃean, “aċt tá storc muice agam ’sa’
mbaile, agus tig leat í ḃeiṫ agad i n-áit airgid.”</p>

<p>Ṗós an sagart iad, agus duḃairt, “cuirfead fios air
an muic amáraċ.”</p>

<p>Nuair ṫáinig Liam go dtí a ḋoras féin, ḃuail sé buille<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
air. Ḃí an ḃean agus an buaċaill-aimsire ag dul ċum
a leabuiḋ, agus d’ḟiafruiġ siad, “cia tá ann sin?”</p>

<p>“Mise,” ar Liam, “fosgail an doras dam.”</p>

<p>Nuair ċualadar an guṫ ḃí ḟios aca gur ’bé Liam do
ḃí ann, agus duḃairt a ḃean, “ní ṫig liom do leigean
asteaċ, agus is mór an náire ḋuit ḃeiṫ teaċt air ais anḋiaiġ
ṫu ḃeiṫ seaċt lá san uaiġ.”</p>

<p>“An air mire atá tu?” ar Liam.</p>

<p>“Ní’lim air mire,” ar san ḃean, “’tá ḟios ag an uile
ḋuine ’sa’ bparáiste go ḃfuair tu bás agus gur ċuir mé
go geanaṁail ṫu. Téiḋ air ais go d’uaiġ, agus béiḋ
aifrionn léiġte agam air son d’anma ḃoiċt amáraċ.”</p>

<p>“Fan go dtagaiḋ solas an laé,” ar Liam, “agus
béarfaiḋ mé luaċ do ṁagaiḋ ḋuit.”</p>

<p>Ann sin ċuaiḋ sé ’san stábla, ’n áit a raiḃ a ċapall
agus a ṁuc, ṡín sé ann san tuiġe, agus ṫuit sé ’nna
ċodlaḋ.</p>

<p>Air maidin, lá air na ṁáraċ, duḃairt an sagart le
buaċaill beag a ḃí aige, “téiḋ go teaċ Liaim Ui Ruanaiġ
agus ḃéarfaiḋ an ḃean a ṗós mé andé muc duit le taḃairt

<p>Ṫáinig an buaċaill go doras an tíġe agus ṫosuiġ ’gá

<p>“Mise,” ar san buaċaill, “ċuir an sagart mé le muc

<p>“Tá sí amuiġ ’san stábla,” ar san ḃean.</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ an buaċaill asteaċ ’san stábla agus ṫosuiġ ag
tiomáint na muiċe amaċ, nuair d’éiriġ Liam agus duḃairt,
“cá ḃfuil tu ag dul le mo ṁuic?”</p>

<p>Nuair ċonnairc an buaċaill Liam, as go bráṫ leis,
agus níor stop go ndeacaiḋ sé ċum an tsagairt agus a

<p>“Cad tá ort?” ar san sagart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>D’innis an buaċaill dó go raiḃ Liam O Ruanaiġ ann san

<p>“Bí do ṫost, a ḃreugadóir,” ar ran sagart, “tá Liam

<p>“Dá mbeiḋ’ sé marḃ seaċt mbliaḋna connairc mise

<p>Ann sin ṫáinig an sagart agus an buaċaill le ċéile go
doras an stábla, agus duḃairt an sagart, “téiḋ asteaċ
agus cuir an ṁuc sin amaċ ċugam.”</p>

<p>“Ní raċfainn asteaċ air son an ṁéid is fiú ṫu,” ar san
buaċaill.</p>

<p>Ċuaiḋ an sagart asteaċ ann sin agus ḃí sé ag tiomáint

duḃairt, “cá ḃfuil tu dul le mo ṁuic, a aṫair Ṗádraig?”</p>

<p>Nuair a ċonnairc an sagart Liam ag éiriġe, as go

<p>Ṫosuiġ Liam ag riṫ anḋiaiġ an tsagairt, agus ag ráḋ.
“A aṫair Ṗádraig ḃfuil tu air mire? fan agus laḃair
Liom.”</p>

<p>Níor ḟan an sagart aċt ċuaiḋ a ḃaile ċoṁ luaṫ agus
d’ḟeud a ċosa a iomċar, agus nuair ṫáinig sé asteaċ ḋún

sáruiġṫe, aċt ní leigfeaḋ an sagart asteaċ é. Faoi
ḋeireaḋ ċuir sé a ċeann amaċ air ḟuinneóig a ḃí air ḃárr

<p>“Tá tu air mire a aṫair Ṗádraig, ní’l mé marḃ, agus
ní raiḃ mé ann aon uaiġ ariaṁ ó d’ḟág me bronn mo

<p>Ċuaiḋ Liam a ḃaile agus ḃuail sé a ḋoras féin aċt ní
leigfeaḋ an ḃean asteaċ é. Ann sin duḃairt sé leis
féin, “raċfad agus íocfad mo ċíos.” Uile ḋuine a ċonnairc
Liam air a ḃealaċ go teaċ an tiġearna ḃí siad ag
riṫ uaiḋ, mar ṡaoileadar go ḃfuair sé bás. Nuair ċualaiḋ
an tiġearna talṁan go raiḃ Liam O Ruanaiġ ag
teaċt ḋún sé na doirse, agus ní leigfeaḋ sé asteaċ
é. Ṫosuiġ Liam ag ḃualaḋ an dorais ṁóir gur ṡaoil an
tiġearna go mbrisfeaḋ sé asteaċ é. Ṫáinig an tiġearna
go fuinneóig a ḃí air ḃárr an tíġe, agus dḟiafruiġ, “cad

<p>“Ṫáinig mé le mo ċíos íoc, mar ḟear cneasta,” ar Liam.</p>

<p>“Téiḋ air ais go dtí d’uaiġ, agus ḃéarfaiḋ mé maiṫeaṁnas

<p>“Ní ḟágfaiḋ mé seó, go ḃfáġ’ mé sgríḃinn uait go

<p>Ṫug an Tiġearna an sgríḃinn dó, agus ṫáinig sé aḃaile.
Ḃuail sé an doras, aċt ní leigfeaó an ḃean asteaċ é, ag

naċ raiḃ ann san ḃfear ag an doras aċt fealltóir.</p>

<p>“Ní fealltóir mé,” ar Liam, “tá mé anḋiaiġ cíos trí

<p>Ċuaiḋ sé ċum an sgiobóil, agus fuair sé barra mór

Ḃí faitċios mór air an mnaoi agus air an ḃfear nuaḋ-ṗósta.

<h2>LEEAM O’ROONEY’S BURIAL.</h2>

<p>In the olden time there was once a man named William
O’Rooney, living near Clare-Galway. He was a farmer.
One day the landlord came to him and said: “I have
three years’ rent on you, and unless you have it for me
within a week I’ll throw you out on the side of the
road.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to Galway with a load of wheat to-morrow,”
said Leeam (William), “and when I get the price of it I’ll
pay you.”</p>

<p>Next morning he put a load of wheat on the cart, and
was going to Galway with it. When he was gone a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
couple of miles from the house a gentleman met him and
asked him: “Is it wheat you’ve got on the cart?”</p>

<p>“It is,” says Leeam; “I’m going to sell it to pay my
rent.”</p>

<p>“How much is there in it?” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“There’s a ton, honest, in it,” said Leeam.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy it from you,” said the gentleman, “and I’ll
give you the biggest price that’s going in the market.
When you’ll go as far as the cart <i>boreen</i> (little road)
that’s on your left hand, turn down, and be going till you
come to a big house in the valley. I’ll be before you
there to give you your money.”</p>

<p>When Leeam came to the <i>boreen</i> he turned in, and was
going until he came as far as the big house. Leeam
wondered when he came as far as the big house, for he
was born and raised (<i>i.e.</i>, reared) in the neighbourhood,
and yet he had never seen the big house before, though
he thought he knew every house within five miles of
him.</p>

<p>When Leeam came near the barn that was close to the
big house, a little lad came out and said: “A hundred
thousand welcomes to you, William O’Rooney,” put a
sack on his back and went in with it. Another little lad
came out and welcomed Leeam, put a sack on his back,
and went in with it. Lads were coming welcoming
Leeam, and putting the sacks on their backs and carrying
them in, until the ton of wheat was all gone. Then the
whole of the lads came round him, and Leeam said; “Ye
all know me, and I don’t know ye!” Then they said to
him: “Go in and eat your dinner; the master’s waiting
for you.”</p>

<p>Leeam went in and sat down at table; but he had not
the second mouthful taken till a heavy sleep came on him,
and he fell down under the table. Then the enchanter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
made a false man like William, and sent him home to
William’s wife with the horse and cart. When the false
man came to Leeam’s house, he went into the room, lay
down on the bed and died.</p>

<p>It was not long till the cry went out that Leeam
O’Rooney was dead. The wife put down water, and
when it was hot she washed the body and put it over the
board (<i>i.e.</i>, laid it out). The neighbours came, and they
keened sorrowfully over the body, and there was great
pity for the poor wife, but there was not much grief on
herself, for Leeam was old and she was young. The day
on the morrow the body was buried, and there was no
more remembrance of Leeam.</p>

<p>Leeam’s wife had a servant boy, and she said to him:
“You ought to marry me, and to take Leeam’s place.”</p>

<p>“It’s too early yet, after there being a death in the
house,” said the boy; “wait till Leeam is a week
buried.”</p>

<p>When Leeam was seven days and seven nights asleep, a
little boy came to him and awoke him, and said: “You’ve
been asleep for a week; but we sent your horse and cart
home. Here’s your money, and go.”</p>

<p>Leeam came home, and as it was late at night nobody
saw him. On the morning of that same day Leeam’s wife
and the servant lad went to the priest and asked him to
marry them.</p>

<p>“Have you the marriage money?” said the priest.</p>

<p>“No,” said the wife; “but I have a <i>sturk</i> of a pig at
home, and you can have her in place of money.”</p>

<p>The priest married them, and said: “I’ll send for the
pig to-morrow.”</p>

<p>When Leeam came to his own door, he struck a blow
on it. The wife and the servant boy were going to bed,
and they asked:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It’s I,” said Leeam; “open the door for me.”</p>

<p>When they heard the voice, they knew that it was
Leeam who was in it, and the wife said: “I can’t let
you in, and it’s a great shame, you to be coming back
again, after being seven days in your grave.”</p>

<p>“Is it mad you are?” said Leeam.</p>

<p>“I’m not mad,” said the wife; “doesn’t every person
in the parish know that you are dead, and that I buried
you decently. Go back to your grave, and I’ll have a
mass read for your poor soul to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Wait till daylight comes,” said Leeam, “and I’ll give
you the price of your joking!”</p>

<p>Then he went into the stable, where his horse and
the pig were, stretched himself in the straw, and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the next day, the priest said
to a little lad that he had: “Get up, and go to Leeam
O’Rooney’s house, and the woman that I married yesterday
will give you a pig to bring home with you.”</p>

<p>The boy came to the door of the house, and began
knocking at it with a stick. The wife was afraid to open
the door, but she asked: “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“I,” said the boy; “the priest sent me to get a pig from
you.”</p>

<p>“She’s out in the stable,” said the wife; “you can get
her for yourself, and drive her back with you.”</p>

<p>The lad went into the stable, and began driving out the
pig, when Leeam rose up and said: “Where are you going
with my pig?”</p>

<p>When the boy saw Leeam he never stopped to look
again, but out with him as hard as he could, and he
never stopped till he came back to the priest, and his
heart coming out of his mouth with terror.</p>

<p>“What’s on you?” says the priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad told him that Leeam O’Rooney was in the
stable, and would not let him drive out the pig.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, you liar!” said the priest;
“Leeam O’Rooney’s dead and in the grave this
week.”</p>

<p>“If he was in the grave this seven years, I saw him
in the stable two moments ago; and if you don’t believe
me, come yourself, and you’ll see him.”</p>

<p>The priest and the boy then went together to the door
of the stable, and the priest said: “Go in and turn me
out that pig.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go in for all ever you’re worth,” said the
boy.</p>

<p>The priest went in, and began driving out the pig, when
Leeam rose up out of the straw and said: “Where are you
going with my pig, Father Patrick?”</p>

<p>When the priest saw Leeam, off and away with him,
and he crying out: “In the name of God, I order you
back to your grave, William O’Rooney.”</p>

<p>Leeam began running after the priest, and saying,
“Father Patrick, Father Patrick, are you mad? Wait
and speak to me.”</p>

<p>The priest would not wait for him, but made off home
as fast as his feet could carry him, and when he got
into the house, he shut the door. Leeam was knocking
at the door till he was tired, but the priest would not let
him in. At last, he put his head out of a window in the
top of the house, and said: “William O’Rooney, go back
to your grave.”</p>

<p>“You’re mad, Father Patrick! I’m not dead, and never
was in a grave since I was born,” said Leeam.</p>

<p>“I saw you dead,” said the priest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> “you died suddenly,
and I was present when you were put into the grave, and
made a fine sermon over you.”</p>

<p>“The devil from me, but, as sure as I’m alive, you’re
mad!” said Leeam.</p>

<p>“Go out of my sight now,” said the priest, “and I’ll
read a mass for you, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Leeam went home then, and knocked at his own door,
but his wife would not let him in. Then he said to himself:
“I may as well go and pay my rent now.” On his
way to the landlord’s house every one who saw Leeam
was running before him, for they thought he was dead.
When the landlord heard that Leeam O’Rooney was
coming, he shut the doors and would not let him in.
Leeam began knocking at the hall-door till the lord
thought he’d break it in. He came to a window in the
top of the house, put out his head, and asked: “What are
you wanting?”</p>

<p>“I’m come to pay my rent like an honest man,” said
Leeam.</p>

<p>“Go back to your grave, and I’ll forgive you your rent,”
said the lord.</p>

<p>“I won’t leave this,” said Leeam, “till I get a writing
from you that I’m paid up clean till next May.”</p>

<p>The lord gave him the writing, and he came home
and knocked at his own door, but the wife would not
let him in. She said that Leeam O’Rooney was dead
and buried, and that the man at the door was only a
deceiver.</p>

<p>“I’m no deceiver,” said William; “I’m after paying my
master three years’ rent, and I’ll have possession of my
own house, or else I’ll know why.”</p>

<p>He went to the barn and got a big bar of iron, and it
wasn’t long till he broke in the door. There was great
fear on the wife, and the newly married husband. They
thought they were in the time of the General Resurrection,
and that the end of the world was coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why did you think I was dead?” said Leeam.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t everybody in the parish know you’re dead?”
said the wife.</p>

<p>“Your body from the devil,” said Leeam, “you’re
humbugging me long enough, and get me something
to eat.”</p>

<p>The poor woman was greatly afraid, and she dressed
him some meat, and when she saw him eating and
drinking, she said: “It’s a miracle.”</p>

<p>Then Leeam told her his story from first to last, and
she told him each thing that happened, and then he said:
“I’ll go to the grave to-morrow, till I see the <i>behoonuch</i>
ye buried in my place.”</p>

<p>The day on the morrow Leeam brought a lot of men
with him to the churchyard, and they dug open the
grave, and were lifting up the coffin, when a big black
dog jumped out of it, and made off, and Leeam and the
men after it. They were following it till they saw it
going into the house in which Leeam had been asleep,
and then the ground opened, and the house went down,
and nobody ever saw it from that out; but the big hole
is to be seen till this day.</p>

<p>When Leeam and the men went home, they told everything
to the priest of the parish, and he dissolved the
marriage that was between Leeam’s wife and the servant
boy.</p>

<p>Leeam lived for years after that, and he left great
wealth behind him, and they remember him in Clare-Galway
still, and will remember him if this story goes
down from the old people to the young.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_VII">GULEESH NA GUSS DHU.</h2>

<p>There was once a boy in the County Mayo, and he never
washed a foot from the day he was born. Guleesh was
his name; but as nobody could ever prevail on him to
wash his feet, they used to call him Guleesh na guss
dhu, or Guleesh Black-foot. It’s often the father said to
him: “Get up, you <i>strone-sha</i> (lubber), and wash yourself,”
but the devil a foot would he get up, and the devil
a foot would he wash. There was no use in talking to
him. Every one used to be humbugging him on account
of his dirty feet, but he paid them no heed nor attention.
You might say anything at all to him, but in spite of it
all he would have his own way afterwards.</p>

<p>One night the whole family were gathered in by the
fire, telling stories and making fun for themselves, and
he amongst them. The father said to him: “Guleesh,
you are one and twenty years old to-night, and I believe
you never washed a foot from the day you were born till
to-day.”</p>

<p>“You lie,” said Guleesh, “didn’t I go a’swimming on
May day last? and I couldn’t keep my feet out of the
water.”</p>

<p>“Well, they were as dirty as ever they were when
you came to the shore,” said the father.</p>

<p>“They were that, surely,” said Guleesh.</p>

<p>“That’s the thing I’m saying,” says the father, “that
it wasn’t in you to wash your feet ever.”</p>

<p>“And I never will wash them till the day of my death,”
said Guleesh.</p>

<p>“You miserable <i>behoonugh</i>! you clown! you tinker!
you good-for-nothing lubber! what kind of answer is
that?” says the father; and with that he drew the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and struck him a hard fist on the jaw. “Be off with yourself,”
says he, “I can’t stand you any longer.”</p>

<p>Guleesh got up and put a hand to his jaw, where he
got the fist. “Only that it’s yourself that’s in it, who gave
me that blow,” said he, “another blow you’d never strike
till the day of your death.” He went out of the house
then and great anger on him.</p>

<p>There was the finest <i>lis</i>, or rath, in Ireland, a little way
off from the gable of the house, and he was often in the
habit of seating himself on the fine grass bank that was
running round it. He stood, and he half leaning against
the gable of the house, and looking up into the sky, and
watching the beautiful white moon over his head. After
him to be standing that way for a couple of hours, he said
to himself: “My bitter grief that I am not gone away
out of this place altogether. I’d sooner be any place in
the world than here. Och, it’s well for you, white moon,”
says he, “that’s turning round, turning round, as you
please yourself, and no man can put you back. I wish
I was the same as you.”</p>

<p>Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard
a great noise coming like the sound of many people
running together, and talking, and laughing, and making
sport, and the sound went by him like a whirl of wind,
and he was listening to it going into the rath. “Musha,
by my soul,” says he, “but ye’re merry enough, and I’ll
follow ye.”</p>

<p>What was in it but the fairy host, though he did not
know at first that it was they who were in it, but he
followed them into the rath. It’s there he heard <i>the
fulparnee, and the folpornee, the rap-lay-hoota, and the
roolya-boolya</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that they had there, and every man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
them crying out as loud as he could: “My horse,
and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and
saddle!”</p>

<p>“By my hand,” said Guleesh, “my boy, that’s not
bad. I’ll imitate ye,” and he cried out as well as they:
“My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and
bridle, and saddle!” And on the moment there was a
fine horse with a bridle of gold, and a saddle of silver,
standing before him. He leaped up on it, and the
moment he was on its back he saw clearly that the rath
was full of horses, and of little people going riding on
them.</p>

<p>Said a man of them to him: “Are you coming with
us to-night, Guleesh?”</p>

<p>“I am, surely,” said Guleesh.</p>

<p>“If you are, come along,” said the little man, and out
with them altogether, riding like the wind, faster than
the fastest horse ever you saw a’hunting, and faster
than the fox and the hounds at his tail.</p>

<p>The cold winter’s wind that was before them, they
overtook her, and the cold winter’s wind that was behind
them, she did not overtake them. And stop nor stay of
that full race, did they make none, until they came to
the brink of the sea.</p>

<p>Then every one of them said: “Hie over cap! Hie
over cap!” and that moment they were up in the air,
and before Guleesh had time to remember where he
was, they were down on dry land again, and were going
like the wind. At last they stood, and a man of them
said to Guleesh: “Guleesh, do you know where you are
now?”</p>

<p>“Not a know,” says Guleesh.</p>

<p>“You’re in Rome, Guleesh,” said he;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> “but we’re going
further than that. The daughter of the king of France
is to be married to-night, the handsomest woman that
the sun ever saw, and we must do our best to bring her
with us, if we’re only able to carry her off; and you
must come with us that we may be able to put the young
girl up behind you on the horse, when we’ll be bringing
her away, for it’s not lawful for us to put her sitting
behind ourselves. But you’re flesh and blood, and she can
take a good grip of you, so that she won’t fall off the
horse. Are you satisfied, Guleesh, and will you do what
we’re telling you?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I be satisfied?” said Guleesh. “I’m
satisfied, surely, and anything that ye will tell me to do
I’ll do it without doubt; but where are we now?”</p>

<p>“You’re in Rome now, Guleesh,” said the sheehogue
(fairy).</p>

<p>“In Rome, is it?” said Guleesh. “Indeed, and no lie,
I’m glad of that. The parish priest that we had he was
broken (suspended) and lost his parish some time ago; I
must go to the Pope till I get a bull from him that will put
him back in his own place again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Guleesh,” said the sheehogue, “you can’t do that.
You won’t be let into the palace; and, anyhow, we can’t
wait for you, for we’re in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“As much as a foot, I won’t go with ye,” says Guleesh,
“till I go to the Pope; but ye can go forward without me,
if ye wish. I won’t stir till I go and get the pardon of my
parish priest.”</p>

<p>“Guleesh, is it out of your senses you are? You can’t
go; and there’s your answer for you now. I tell you, you
can’t go.”</p>

<p>“Can’t ye go on, and to leave me here after ye,” said
Guleesh, “and when ye come back can’t ye hoist the
girl up behind me?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>“But we want you at the palace of the king of
France,” said the sheehogue, “and you must come with
us now.”</p>

<p>“The devil a foot,” said Guleesh, “till I get the priest’s
pardon; the honestest and the pleasantest man that’s in
Ireland.”</p>

<p>Another sheehogue spoke then, and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t be so hard on Guleesh. The boy’s a kind boy,
and he has a good heart; and as he doesn’t wish to come
without the Pope’s bull, we must do our best to get it
for him. He and I will go in to the Pope, and ye can
wait here.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks to you,” said Guleesh. “I’m ready
to go with you; for this priest, he was the sportingest and
the pleasantest man in the world.”</p>

<p>“You have too much talk, Guleesh,” said the sheehogue,
“but come along now. Get off your horse and take my
hand.”</p>

<p>Guleesh dismounted, and took his hand; and then the
little man said a couple of words he did not understand,
and before he knew where he was he found himself in the
room with the Pope.</p>

<p>The Pope was sitting up late that night reading a book
that he liked. He was sitting on a big soft chair, and his
two feet on the chimney-board. There was a fine fire
in the grate, and a little table standing at his elbow,
and a drop of ishka-baha (eau-de-vie) and sugar on the
little table<i>een</i>; and he never felt till Guleesh came up
behind him.</p>

<p>“Now Guleesh,” said the sheehogue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> “tell him that
unless he gives you the bull you’ll set the room on fire;
and if he refuses it to you, I’ll spurt fire round about out
of my mouth, till he thinks the place is really in a blaze,
and I’ll go bail he’ll be ready enough then to give you
the pardon.”</p>

<p>Guleesh went up to him and put his hand on his
shoulder. The Pope turned round, and when he saw
Guleesh standing behind him he frightened up.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Guleesh, “we have a parish
priest at home, and some thief told your honour a lie
about him, and he was broken; but he’s the decentest
man ever your honour saw, and there’s not a man,
woman, or child in Ballynatoothach but’s in love with
him.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, you <i>bodach</i>,” said the Pope.
“Where are you from, or what brought you here?
Haven’t I a lock on the door?”</p>

<p>“I came in on the keyhole,” says Guleesh, “and I’d be
very much obliged to your honour if you’d do what I’m
asking.”</p>

<p>The Pope cried out: “Where are all my people?
Where are my servants? Shamus! Shawn! I’m killed;
I’m robbed.”</p>

<p>Guleesh put his back to the door, the way he could not
get out, and he was afraid to go near Guleesh, so he had
no help for it, but had to listen to Guleesh’s story; and
Guleesh could not tell it to him shortly and plainly, for
he was slow and coarse in his speaking, and that angered
the Pope; and when Guleesh finished his story, he vowed
that he never would give the priest his pardon; and he
threatened Guleesh himself that he would put him to
death for his shamelessness in coming in upon him in the
night; and he began again crying out for his servants.
Whether the servants heard him or no, there was a lock
on the inside of the door, so that they could not come in
to him.</p>

<p>“Unless you give me a bull under your hand and seal,
and the priest’s pardon in it,” said Guleesh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> “I’ll burn
your house with fire.”</p>

<p>The sheehogue, whom the Pope did not see, began to
cast fire and flame out of his mouth, and the Pope thought
that the room was all in a blaze. He cried out: “Oh,
eternal destruction! I’ll give you the pardon; I’ll give
you anything at all, only stop your fire, and don’t burn
me in my own house.”</p>

<p>The sheehogue stopped the fire, and the Pope had to
sit down and write a full pardon for the priest, and give
him back his old place again, and when he had it ready
written, he put his name under it on the paper, and put
it into Guleesh’s hand.</p>

<p>“Thank your honour,” said Guleesh; “I never
will come here again to you, and <i>bannacht lath</i> (good-bye).”</p>

<p>“Do not,” said the Pope; “if you do I’ll be ready
before you, and you won’t go from me so easily again.
You will be shut up in a prison, and you won’t get out
for ever.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, I won’t come again,” said Guleesh.
And before he could say any more the sheehogue spoke
a couple of words, and caught Guleesh’s hand again, and
out with them. Guleesh found himself amongst the other
sheehogues, and his horse waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Now, Guleesh,” said they, “it’s greatly you stopped
us, and we in such a hurry; but come on now, and don’t
think of playing such a trick again, for we won’t wait
for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m satisfied,” said Guleesh, “and I’m thankful to ye;
but tell me where are we going.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to the palace of the king of France,” said
they; “and if we can at all, we’re to carry off his daughter
with us.”</p>

<p>Every man of them then said, “Rise up, horse;” and
the horses began leaping, and running, and prancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The cold wind of winter that was before them they overtook
her, and the cold wind of winter that was behind
them, she did not overtake them, and they never stopped
of that race, till they came as far as the palace of the king
of France.</p>

<p>They got off their horses there, and a man of them
said a word that Guleesh did not understand, and on
the moment they were lifted up, and Guleesh found himself
and his companions in the palace. There was a
great feast going on there, and there was not a nobleman
or a gentleman in the kingdom but was gathered
there, dressed in silk and satin, and gold and silver, and
the night was as bright as the day with all the lamps
and candles that were lit, and Guleesh had to shut his
two eyes at the brightness. When he opened them
again and looked from him, he thought he never saw
anything as fine as all he saw there. There were a hundred
tables spread out, and their full of meat and drink
on each table of them, flesh-meat, and cakes and sweetmeats,
and wine and ale, and every drink that ever a
man saw. The musicians were at the two ends of the
hall, and they playing the sweetest music that ever a
man’s ear heard, and there were young women and fine
youths in the middle of the hall, dancing and turning,
and going round so quickly and so lightly, that it put a
<i>soorawn</i> in Guleesh’s head to be looking at them. There
were more there playing tricks, and more making fun
and laughing, for such a feast as there was that day had
not been in France for twenty years, because the old
king had no children alive but only the one daughter,
and she was to be married to the son of another king
that night. Three days the feast was going on, and the
third night she was to be married, and that was the
night that Guleesh and the sheehogues came, hoping if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
they could, to carry off with them the king’s young
daughter.</p>

<p>Guleesh and his companions were standing together
at the head of the hall, where there was a fine altar
dressed up, and two bishops behind it waiting to marry
the girl, as soon as the right time should come. Nobody
could see the sheehogues, for they said a word as they
came in, that made them all invisible, as if they had not
been in it at all.</p>

<p>“Tell me which of them is the king’s daughter,” said
Guleesh, when he was becoming a little used to the noise
and the light.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see her there from you?” said the little man
that he was talking to.</p>

<p>Guleesh looked where the little man was pointing with
his finger, and there he saw the loveliest woman that
was, he thought, upon the ridge of the world. The rose
and the lily were fighting together in her face, and one
could not tell which of them got the victory. Her arms
and hands were like the lime, her mouth as red as a
strawberry, when it is ripe, her foot was as small and as
light as another one’s hand, her form was smooth and
slender, and her hair was falling down from her head in
buckles of gold. Her garments and dress were woven
with gold and silver, and the bright stone that was in
the ring on her hand was as shining as the sun.</p>

<p>Guleesh was nearly blinded with all the loveliness and
beauty that was in her; but when he looked again, he
saw that she was crying, and that there was the trace of
tears in her eyes. “It can’t be,” said Guleesh, “that
there’s grief on her, when everybody round her is so full
of sport and merriment.”</p>

<p>“Musha, then, she is grieved,” said the little man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
“for it’s against her own will she’s marrying, and she
has no love for the husband she is to marry. The king
was going to give her to him three years ago, when she
was only fifteen, but she said she was too young, and
requested him to leave her as she was yet. The king gave
her a year’s grace, and when that year was up he gave
her another year’s grace, and then another; but a week
or a day he would not give her longer, and she is
eighteen years old to-night, and it’s time for her to
marry; but, indeed,” says he, and he crooked his mouth
in an ugly way; “indeed, it’s no king’s son she’ll marry,
if I can help it.”</p>

<p>Guleesh pitied the handsome young lady greatly when
he heard that, and he was heart-broken to think that it
would be necessary for her to marry a man she did not
like, or what was worse, to take a nasty Sheehogue for
a husband. However, he did not say a word, though
he could not help giving many a curse to the ill-luck
that was laid out for himself, and he helping the people
that were to snatch her away from her home and from
her father.</p>

<p>He began thinking, then, what it was he ought to do
to save her, but he could think of nothing. “Oh, if I
could only give her some help and relief,” said he, “I
wouldn’t care whether I were alive or dead; but I see
nothing that I can do for her.”</p>

<p>He was looking on when the king’s son came up to
her and asked her for a kiss, but she turned her head
away from him. Guleesh had double pity for her then,
when he saw the lad taking her by the soft white hand,
and drawing her out to dance. They went round in
the dance near where Guleesh was, and he could plainly
see that there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>When the dancing was over, the old king, her father,
and her mother, the queen, came up and said that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was the right time to marry her, that the bishop was
ready and the couch prepared, and it was time to put
the wedding-ring on her and give her to her husband.</p>

<p>The old king put a laugh out of him: “Upon my
honour,” he said, “the night is nearly spent, but my
son will make a night for himself. I’ll go bail he won’t
rise early to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Musha, and maybe he would,” said the Sheehogue
in Guleesh’s ear, “or not go to bed, perhaps, at all.
Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>Guleesh gave him no answer, for his two eyes were
going out on his head watching to see what they would
do then.</p>

<p>The king took the youth by the hand, and the queen
took her daughter, and they went up together to the
altar, with the lords and great people following them.</p>

<p>When they came near the altar, and were no more
than about four yards from it, the little sheehogue
stretched out his foot before the girl, and she fell. Before
she was able to rise again he threw something that
was in his hand upon her, said a couple of words, and
upon the moment the maiden was gone from amongst
them. Nobody could see her, for that word made her
invisible. The little man<i>een</i> seized her and raised her
up behind Guleesh, and the king nor no one else saw
them, but out with them through the hall till they came
to the door.</p>

<p>Oro! dear Mary! it’s there the pity was, and the
trouble, and the crying, and the wonder, and the searching,
and the <i>rookawn</i>, when that lady disappeared from
their eyes, and without their seeing what did it. Out
on the door of the palace with them, without being
stopped or hindered, for nobody saw them, and, “My
horse, my bridle, and saddle!” says every man of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“My horse, my bridle, and saddle!” says Guleesh;
and on the moment the horse was standing ready
caparisoned before him. “Now, jump up, Guleesh,”
said the little man, “and put the lady behind you,
and we will be going; the morning is not far off from
us now.”</p>

<p>Guleesh raised her up on the horse’s back, and leaped
up himself before her, and, “Rise horse,” said he; and
his horse, and the other horses with him, went in a full
race until they came to the sea.</p>

<p>“Highover, cap!” said every man of them.</p>

<p>“Highover, cap!” said Guleesh; and on the moment
the horse rose under him, and cut a leap in the clouds,
and came down in Erin.</p>

<p>They did not stop there, but went of a race to the
place where was Guleesh’s house and the rath. And
when they came as far as that, Guleesh turned and caught
the young girl in his two arms, and leaped off the horse.</p>

<p>“I call and cross you to myself, in the name of God!”
said he; and on the spot, before the word was out of his
mouth, the horse fell down, and what was in it but the
beam of a plough, of which they had made a horse; and
every other horse they had, it was that way they made
it. Some of them were riding on an old besom, and
some on a broken stick, and more on a <i>bohalawn</i> (rag
weed), or a hemlock-stalk.</p>

<p>The good people called out together when they heard
what Guleesh said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good
may happen you, why did you play that trick on us?”</p>

<p>But they had no power at all to carry off the girl, after
Guleesh had consecrated her to himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, Guleesh, isn’t that a nice turn you did us, and
we so kind to you? What good have we now out of
our journey to Rome and to France? Never mind yet,
you clown, but you’ll pay us another time for this. Believe
us you’ll repent it.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have no good to get out of the young girl,” said
the little man that was talking to him in the palace
before that, and as he said the word he moved over to her
and struck her a slap on the side of the head. “Now,”
says he, “she’ll be without talk any more; now, Guleesh,
what good will she be to you when she’ll be dumb? It’s
time for us to go—but you’ll remember us, Guleesh na
Guss Dhu!”</p>

<p>When he said that he stretched out his two hands,
and before Guleesh was able to give an answer, he and
the rest of them were gone into the rath out of his sight,
and he saw them no more.</p>

<p>He turned to the young woman and said to her:
“Thanks be to God, they’re gone. Would you not sooner
stay with me than with them?” She gave him no answer.
“There’s trouble and grief on her yet,” said Guleesh in his
own mind, and he spoke to her again: “I am afraid that
you must spend this night in my father’s house, lady, and
if there is anything that I can do for you, tell me, and I’ll
be your servant.”</p>

<p>The beautiful girl remained silent, but there were
tears in her eyes, and her face was white and red after
each other.</p>

<p>“Lady,” said Guleesh, “tell me what you would like
me to do now. I never belonged at all to that lot of
sheehogues who carried you away with them. I am
the son of an honest farmer, and I went with them without
knowing it. If I’ll be able to send you back to your
father I’ll do it, and I pray you make any use of me
now that you may wish.”</p>

<p>He looked into her face, and he saw the mouth moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as if she was going to speak, but there came no word
from it.</p>

<p>“It cannot be,” said Guleesh, “that you are dumb.
Did I not hear you speaking to the king’s son in the
palace to-night? Or has that devil made you really
dumb, when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw?”</p>

<p>The girl raised her white smooth hand, and laid her
finger on her tongue, to show him that she had lost her
voice and power of speech, and the tears ran out of her
two eyes like streams, and Guleesh’s own eyes were not
dry, for as rough as he was on the outside he had a soft
heart, and could not stand the sight of the young girl,
and she in that unhappy plight.</p>

<p>He began thinking with himself what he ought to do,
and he did not like to bring her home with himself to his
father’s house, for he knew well that they would not
believe him, that he had been in France and brought
back with him the king of France’s daughter, and he was
afraid they might make a mock of the young lady or
insult her.</p>

<p>As he was doubting what he ought to do, and
hesitating, he chanced to put his hand in his pocket,
and he found a paper in it. He pulled it up, and the
moment he looked at it he remembered it was the
Pope’s bull. “Glory be to God,” said he, “I know
now what I’ll do; I’ll bring her to the priest’s house,
and as soon as he sees the pardon I have here, he won’t
refuse me to keep the lady and care her.” He turned
to the lady again and told her that he was loath to take
her to his father’s house, but that there was an excellent
priest very friendly to himself, who would take good
care of her, if she wished to remain in his house; but that
if there was any other place she would rather go, he
said he would bring her to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>She bent her head, to show him she was obliged, and
gave him to understand that she was ready to follow him
any place he was going. “We will go to the priest’s
house, then,” said he; “he is under an obligation to me,
and will do anything I ask him.”</p>

<p>They went together accordingly to the priest’s house,
and the sun was just rising when they came to the door.
Guleesh beat it hard, and as early as it was the priest was
up, and opened the door himself. He wondered when
he saw Guleesh and the girl, for he was certain that it
was coming wanting to be married they were.</p>

<p>“Guleesh na Guss Dhu, isn’t it the nice boy you are
that you can’t wait till ten o’clock or till twelve, but that
you must be coming to me at this hour, looking for
marriage, you and your <i>girshuch</i>. You ought to know
that I’m broken, and that I can’t marry you, or at all
events, can’t marry you lawfully. But ubbubboo!” said
he, suddenly, as he looked again at the young girl, “in
the name of God, who have you here? Who is she, or
how did you get her?”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Guleesh, “you can marry me, or anybody
else, any more, if you wish; but it’s not looking for
marriage I came to you now, but to ask you, if you
please, to give a lodging in your house to this young
lady.” And with that he drew out the Pope’s bull, and
gave it to the priest to read.</p>

<p>The priest took it, and read it, and looked sharply at
the writing and seal, and he had no doubt but it was a
right bull, from the hand of the Pope.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” said he to Guleesh, and the
hand he held the paper in, was trembling with wonder
and joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, musha!” said Guleesh, airily enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> “I got it
last night in Rome; I remained a couple of hours in the
city there, when I was on my way to bring this young
lady, daughter of the king of France, back with me.”</p>

<p>The priest looked at him as though he had ten heads
on him; but without putting any other question to him,
he desired him to come in, himself and the maiden, and
when they came in, he shut the door, brought them into
the parlour, and put them sitting.</p>

<p>“Now, Guleesh,” said he, “tell me truly where did you
get this bull, and who is this young lady, and whether
you’re out of your senses really, or are only making a
joke of me?”</p>

<p>“I’m not telling a word of lie, nor making a joke of
you,” said Guleesh; “but it was from the Pope himself
I got the paper, and it was from the palace of the king
of France I carried off this lady, and she is the daughter
of the king of France.”</p>

<p>He began his story then, and told the whole to the
priest, and the priest was so much surprised that he
could not help calling out at times, or clapping his hands
together.</p>

<p>When Guleesh said from what he saw he thought the
girl was not satisfied with the marriage that was going
to take place in the palace before he and the sheehogues
broke it up, there came a red blush into the girl’s cheek,
and he was more certain than ever that she had sooner be
as she was—badly as she was—than be the married wife
of the man she hated. When Guleesh said that he would
be very thankful to the priest if he would keep her in his
own house, the kind man said he would do that as long
as Guleesh pleased, but that he did not know what they
ought to do with her, because they had no means of
sending her back to her father again.</p>

<p>Guleesh answered that he was uneasy about the same
thing, and that he saw nothing to do but to keep quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
until they should find some opportunity of doing something
better. They made it up then between themselves
that the priest should let on that it was his brother’s
daughter he had, who was come on a visit to him from
another county, and that he should tell everybody that
she was dumb, and do his best to keep everyone away
from her. They told the young girl what it was they
intended to do, and she showed by her eyes that she was
obliged to them.</p>

<p>Guleesh went home then, and when his people asked
him where he was, he said that he was asleep at the foot
of the ditch, and passed the night there.</p>

<p>There was great wonderment on the neighbours when
the honest priest showed them the Pope’s bull, and got his
old place again, and everyone was rejoiced, for, indeed,
there was no fault at all in that honest man, except that
now and again he would have too much liking for a drop
of the bottle; but no one could say that he ever saw him
in a way that he could not utter “here’s to your health,” as
well as ever a man in the kingdom. But if they wondered
to see the priest back again in his old place, much more
did they wonder at the girl who came so suddenly to his
house without anyone knowing where she was from, or
what business she had there. Some of the people said
that everything was not as it ought to be, and others
that it was not possible that the Pope gave back his place
to the priest after taking it from him before, on account
of the complaints about his drinking. And there were
more of them, too, who said that Guleesh na Guss Dhu
was not like the same man that was in it before, and that
it was a great story (<i>i.e.</i>, a thing to wonder at) how he was
drawing every day to the priest’s house, and that the
priest had a wish and a respect for him, a thing they could
not clear up at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>That was true for them, indeed, for it was seldom the
day went by but Guleesh would go to the priest’s house,
and have a talk with him, and as often as he would come
he used to hope to find the young lady well again, and
with leave to speak; but, alas! she remained dumb and
silent, without relief or cure. Since she had no other
means of talking she carried on a sort of conversation
between herself and himself, by moving her hand and
fingers, winking her eyes, opening and shutting her
mouth, laughing or smiling, and a thousand other signs,
so that it was not long until they understood each other
very well. Guleesh was always thinking how he should
send her back to her father; but there was no one to
go with her, and he himself did not know what road
to go, for he had never been out of his own country
before the night he brought her away with him. Nor had
the priest any better knowledge than he; but when
Guleesh asked him, he wrote three or four letters to the
king of France, and gave them to buyers and sellers of
wares, who used to be going from place to place across
the sea; but they all went astray, and never one came to
the king’s hand.</p>

<p>This was the way they were for many months, and
Guleesh was falling deeper and deeper in love with her
every day, and it was plain to himself and the priest that
she liked him. The boy feared greatly at last, lest the
king should really hear where his daughter was, and take
her back from himself, and he besought the priest to write
no more, but to leave the matter to God.</p>

<p>So they passed the time for a year, until there came a
day when Guleesh was lying by himself on the grass,
on the last day of the last month in autumn (<i>i.e.</i> October),
and he thinking over again in his own mind of everything
that happened to him from the day that he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with the sheehogues across the sea. He remembered
then, suddenly, that it was one November night that
he was standing at the gable of the house, when the
whirlwind came, and the sheehogues in it, and he said
to himself: “We have November night again to-day,
and I’ll stand in the same place I was last year, until I see
will the good people come again. Perhaps I might see
or hear something that would be useful to me, and might
bring back her talk again to Mary”—that was the name
himself and the priest called the king’s daughter, for
neither of them knew her right name. He told his
intention to the priest, and the priest gave him his
blessing.</p>

<p>Guleesh accordingly went to the old rath when the
night was darkening, and he stood with his bent elbow
leaning on a gray old flag, waiting till the middle of the
night should come. The moon rose slowly, and it was
like a knob of fire behind him; and there was a white
fog which was raised up over the fields of grass and all
damp places, through the coolness of the night after a
great heat in the day. The night was calm as is a lake
when there is not a breath of wind to move a wave on
it, and there was no sound to be heard but the <i>cronawn</i>
(hum) of the insects that would go by from time to time,
or the hoarse sudden scream of the wild-geese, as they
passed from lake to lake, half a mile up in the air over
his head; or the sharp whistle of the fadogues and
flibeens (golden and green plover), rising and lying, lying
and rising, as they do on a calm night. There were a
thousand thousand bright stars shining over his head,
and there was a little frost out, which left the grass
under his foot white and crisp.</p>

<p>He stood there for an hour, for two hours, for three
hours, and the frost increased greatly, so that he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the breaking of the <i>traneens</i> under his foot as often as he
moved. He was thinking, in his own mind, at last, that
the sheehogues would not come that night, and that it
was as good for him to return back again, when he heard
a sound far away from him, coming towards him, and he
recognised what it was at the first moment. The sound
increased, and at first it was like the beating of waves on
a stony shore, and then it was like the falling of a great
waterfall, and at last it was like a loud storm in the tops
of the trees, and then the whirlwind burst into the rath
of one rout, and the sheehogues were in it.</p>

<p>It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath
with it, but he came to himself on the spot, and put an
ear on himself, listening to what they would say.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they gathered into the rath till they all
began shouting, and screaming, and talking amongst
themselves; and then each one of them cried out: “My
horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and
saddle!” and Guleesh took courage, and called out as
loudly as any of them: “My horse, and bridle, and
saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!” But before
the word was well out of his mouth, another man
cried out: “Ora! Guleesh, my boy, are you here with us
again? How are you coming on with your woman?
There’s no use in your calling for your horse to-night.
I’ll go bail you won’t play on us again. It was a good
trick you played on us last year!”</p>

<p>“It was,” said another man, “he won’t do it again.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a prime lad, the same lad! to take a woman
with him that never said as much to him as, ‘how do you
do?’ since this time last year!” says the third man.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he likes to be looking at her,” said another
voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>“And if the <i>omadawn</i> only knew that there’s an herb
growing up by his own door, and to boil it and give it
to her and she’d be well,” said another voice.</p>

<p>“That’s true for you.”</p>

<p>“He is an omadawn.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother your head with him, we’ll be going.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave the <i>bodach</i> as he is.”</p>

<p>And with that they rose up into the air, and out with
them of one <i>roolya-boolya</i> the way they came; and they
left poor Guleesh standing where they found him, and
the two eyes going out of his head, looking after them,
and wondering.</p>

<p>He did not stand long till he returned back, and he
thinking in his own mind on all he saw and heard, and
wondering whether there was really an herb at his own
door that would bring back the talk to the king’s daughter.
“It can’t be,” says he to himself, “that they would tell it
to me, if there was any virtue in it; but perhaps the
sheehogue didn’t observe himself when he let the word
slip out of his mouth. I’ll search well as soon as the
sun rises, whether there’s any plant growing beside the
house except thistles and dockings.”</p>

<p>He went home, and as tired as he was he did not sleep
a wink until the sun rose on the morrow. He got up
then, and it was the first thing he did to go out and search
well through the grass round about the house, trying
could he get any herb that he did not recognize. And,
indeed, he was not long searching till he observed a large
strange herb that was growing up just by the gable of the
house.</p>

<p>He went over to it, and observed it closely, and saw
that there were seven little branches coming out of the
stalk, and seven leaves growing on every branch<i>een</i> of
them, and that there was a white sap in the leaves. “It’s
very wonderful,” said he to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> “that I never noticed
this herb before. If there’s any virtue in an herb at all, it
ought to be in such a strange one as this.”</p>

<p>He drew out his knife, cut the plant, and carried it
into his own house; stripped the leaves off it and cut
up the stalk; and there came a thick, white juice out of
it, as there comes out of the sow-thistle when it is bruised,
except that the juice was more like oil.</p>

<p>He put it in a little pot and a little water in it, and
laid it on the fire until the water was boiling, and then
he took a cup, filled it half up with the juice, and put it
to his own mouth. It came into his head then that
perhaps it was poison that was in it, and that the good
people were only tempting him that he might kill himself
with that trick, or put the girl to death without
meaning it. He put down the cup again, raised a couple
of drops on the top of his finger, and put it to his mouth.
It was not bitter, and, indeed, had a sweet, agreeable
taste. He grew bolder then, and drank the full of a
thimble of it, and then as much again, and he never
stopped till he had half the cup drunk. He fell asleep
after that, and did not wake till it was night, and there
was great hunger and great thirst on him.</p>

<p>He had to wait, then, till the day rose; but he determined,
as soon as he should wake in the morning, that
he would go to the king’s daughter and give her a drink
of the juice of the herb.</p>

<p>As soon as he got up in the morning, he went over to
the priest’s house with the drink in his hand, and he
never felt himself so bold and valiant, and spirited and
light, as he was that day, and he was quite certain that it
was the drink he drank which made him so hearty.</p>

<p>When he came to the house, he found the priest and
the young lady within, and they were wondering greatly
why he had not visited them for two days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>He told them all his news, and said that he was certain
that there was great power in that herb, and that it would
do the lady no hurt, for he tried it himself and got good
from it, and then he made her taste it, for he vowed and
swore that there was no harm in it.</p>

<p>Guleesh handed her the cup, and she drank half of it,
and then fell back on her bed and a heavy sleep came
on her, and she never woke out of that sleep till the day
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Guleesh and the priest sat up the entire night with her,
waiting till she should awake, and they between hope and
unhope, between expectation of saving her and fear of
hurting her.</p>

<p>She awoke at last when the sun had gone half its way
through the heavens. She rubbed her eyes and looked
like a person who did not know where she was. She was
like one astonished when she saw Guleesh and the priest
in the same room with her, and she sat up doing her best
to collect her thoughts.</p>

<p>The two men were in great anxiety waiting to see
would she speak, or would she not speak, and when they
remained silent for a couple of minutes, the priest said
to her: “Did you sleep well, Mary?”</p>

<p>And she answered him: “I slept, thank you.”</p>

<p>No sooner did Guleesh hear her talking than he put a
shout of joy out of him, and ran over to her and fell on
his two knees, and said: “A thousand thanks to God,
who has given you back the talk; lady of my heart, speak
again to me.”</p>

<p>The lady answered him that she understood it was he
who boiled that drink for her, and gave it to her; that she
was obliged to him from her heart for all the kindness he
showed her since the day she first came to Ireland, and
that he might be certain that she would never forget it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight.
Then they brought her food, and she eat with a good
appetite, and was merry and joyous, and never left off
talking with the priest while she was eating.</p>

<p>After that Guleesh went home to his house, and
stretched himself on the bed and fell asleep again, for
the force of the herb was not all spent, and he passed
another day and a night sleeping. When he woke up he
went back to the priest’s house, and found that the young
lady was in the same state, and that she was asleep almost
since the time that he left the house.</p>

<p>He went into her chamber with the priest, and they
remained watching beside her till she awoke the second
time, and she had her talk as well as ever, and Guleesh
was greatly rejoiced. The priest put food on the table
again, and they eat together, and Guleesh used after that
to come to the house from day to day, and the friendship
that was between him and the king’s daughter increased,
because she had no one to speak to except Guleesh and
the priest, and she liked Guleesh best.</p>

<p>He had to tell her the way he was standing by the
rath when the good people came, and how he went in to
the Pope, and how the sheehogue blew fire out of his
mouth, and every other thing that he did till the time
the good people whipt her off with themselves; and
when it would be all told he would have to begin it
again out of the new, and she never was tired listening
to him.</p>

<p>When they had been that way for another half year,
she said that she could wait no longer without going
back to her father and mother; that she was certain
that they were greatly grieved for her; and that it was
a shame for her to leave them in grief, when it was in
her power to go as far as them. The priest did all he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
could to keep her with them for another while, but without
effect, and Guleesh spoke every sweet word that came
into his head, trying to get the victory over her, and to
coax her and make her stay as she was, but it was no
good for him. She determined that she would go, and
no man alive would make her change her intention.</p>

<p>She had not much money, but only two rings that were
on her hand, when the sheehogue carried her away, and a
gold pin that was in her hair, and golden buckles that
were on her little shoes.</p>

<p>The priest took and sold them and gave her the money,
and she said that she was ready to go.</p>

<p>She left her blessing and farewell with the priest and
Guleesh, and departed. She was not long gone till there
came such grief and melancholy over Guleesh that he
knew he would not be long alive unless he were near
her, and he followed her.</p>

<p>It was well, and it was not ill. They married one

<h2 id="TALE_VIII">THE WELL OF D’YERREE-IN-DOWAN.</h2>

<p>A long time ago—before St. Patrick’s time—there was
an old king in Connacht, and he had three sons. The
king had a sore foot for many years, and he could get
no cure. One day he sent for the Dall Glic (wise blind
man) which he had, and said to him:</p>

<p>“I’m giving you wages this twenty years, and you
can’t tell me what will cure my foot.”</p>

<p>“You never asked me that question before,” said the
Dall Glic; “but I tell you now that there is nothing in the
world to cure you but a bottle of water from the Well of
D’yerree-in-Dowan” (<i>i.e.</i>, end of the world).</p>

<p>In the morning, the day on the morrow, the king
called his three sons, and he said to them:</p>

<p>“My foot will never be better until I get a bottle of
water from the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan, and whichever
of you will bring me that, he has my kingdom
to get.”</p>

<p>“We will go in pursuit of it to-morrow,” says the three.
The names of the three were Art, Nart (<i>i.e.</i>, strength), and
Cart<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (<i>i.e.</i>, right).</p>

<p>On the morning of the day on the morrow, the king
gave to each one of them a purse of gold, and they went
on their way. When they came as far as the cross-roads,
Art said:</p>

<p>“Each one of us ought to go a road for himself, and if
one of us is back before a year and a day, let him wait
till the other two come; or else let him set up a stone as
a sign that he has come back safe.”</p>

<p>They parted from one another after that, and Art and
Nart went to an inn and began drinking; but Cart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
went on by himself. He walked all that day without
knowing where he was going. As the darkness of the
night came on he was entering a great wood, and he was
going forwards in the wood, until he came to a large
house. He went in and looked round him, but he saw
nobody, except a large white cat sitting beside the fire.
When the cat saw him she rose up and went into another
room. He was tired and sat beside the fire. It was
not long till the door of the chamber opened, and there
came out an old hag.</p>

<p>“One hundred thousand welcomes before you, son of
the king of Connacht,” says the hag.</p>

<p>“How did you know me?” says the king’s son.</p>

<p>“Oh, many’s the good day I spent in your father’s
castle in Bwee-sounee, and I know you since you were
born,” said the hag.</p>

<p>Then she prepared him a fine supper, and gave it to
him. When he had eaten and drunk enough, she said
to him:</p>

<p>“You made a long journey to-day; come with me
until I show you a bed.” Then she brought him to a fine
chamber, showed him a bed, and the king’s son fell
asleep. He did not awake until the sun was coming in
on the windows the next morning.</p>

<p>Then he rose up, dressed himself, and was going out,
when the hag asked him where he was going.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the king’s son. “I left home to
find out the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan.”</p>

<p>“I’m after walking a good many places,” said the hag,
“but I never heard talk of the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan
before.”</p>

<p>The king’s son went out, and he was travelling till he
came to a cross-roads between two woods. He did not
know which road to take. He saw a seat under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
trunk of a great tree. When he went up to it he found it
written: “This is the seat of travellers.”</p>

<p>The king’s son sat down, and after a minute he saw
the most lovely woman in the world coming towards him,
and she dressed in red silk, and she said to him:</p>

<p>“I often heard that it is better to go forward than
back.”</p>

<p>Then she went out of his sight as though the ground
should swallow her.</p>

<p>The king’s son rose up and went forward. He walked
that day till the darkness of the night was coming on,
and he did not know where to get lodgings. He saw a
light in a wood, and he drew towards it. The light was
in a little house. There was not as much as the end of
a feather jutting up on the outside nor jutting down on
the inside, but only one single feather that was keeping
up the house. He knocked at the door, and an old hag
opened it.</p>

<p>“God save all here,” says the king’s son.</p>

<p>“A hundred welcomes before you, son of the king of
the castle of Bwee-sounee,” said the hag.</p>

<p>“How do you know me?” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>“It was my sister nursed you,” said the hag, “and sit
down till I get your supper ready.”</p>

<p>When he ate and drank his enough, she put him to
sleep till morning. When he rose up in the morning, he
prayed to God to direct him on the road of his luck.</p>

<p>“How far will you go to-day?” said the hag.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the king’s son. “I’m in search
of the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan.”</p>

<p>“I’m three hundred years here,” said the hag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> “and I
never heard of such a place before; but I have a sister
older than myself, and, perhaps, she may know of it.
Here is a ball of silver for you, and when you will go out
upon the road throw it up before you, and follow it till
you come to the house of my sister.”</p>

<p>When he went out on the road he threw down the
ball, and he was following it until the sun was going
under the shadow of the hills. Then he went into a
wood, and came to the door of a little house. When he
struck the door, a hag opened it and said:</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand welcomes before you, son of the
king of the castle of Bwee-sounee, who were at my
sister’s house last night. You made a long journey to-day.
Sit down; I have a supper ready for you.”</p>

<p>When the king’s son ate and drank his enough, the
hag put him to sleep, and he did not wake up till the
morning. Then the hag asked:</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t rightly know,” said the king’s son. “I left
home to find out the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan.”</p>

<p>“I am over five hundred years of age,” said the hag,
“and I never heard talk of that place before; but I have
a brother, and if there is any such place in the world, he’ll
know of it. He is living seven hundred miles from here.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long journey,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>“You’ll be there to-night,” said the hag.</p>

<p>Then she gave him a little garraun (nag, gelding)
about the size of a goat.</p>

<p>“That little beast won’t be able to carry me,” said the
king’s son.</p>

<p>“Wait till you go riding on it,” said the hag.</p>

<p>The king’s son got on the garraun, and out for ever
with him as fast as lightning.</p>

<p>When the sun was going under, that evening, he came
to a little house in a wood. The king’s son got off the
garraun, went in, and it was not long till an old grey
man came out, and said:</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand welcomes to you, son of the
king of the castle of Bwee-sounee. You’re in search of
the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan.”</p>

<p>“I am, indeed,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>“Many’s the good man went that way before you; but
not a man of them came back alive,” said the old man;
“however, I’ll do my best for you. Stop here to-night,
and we’ll have sport to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then he dressed a supper and gave it to the king’s son,
and when he ate and drank, the old man put him to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning of the day on the morrow, the old man
said:</p>

<p>“I found out where the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan is;
but it is difficult to go as far as it. We must find out if
there’s any good in you with the tight loop (bow?).”</p>

<p>Then he brought the king’s son out into the wood,
gave him the loop, and put a mark on a tree two score
yards from him, and told him to strike it. He drew the
loop and struck the mark.</p>

<p>“You’ll do the business,” said the old man.</p>

<p>They then went in, and spent the day telling stories
till the darkness of the night was come.</p>

<p>When the darkness of the night was come, the old
man gave him a loop (bow?) and a sheaf of sharp stings
(darts), and said:</p>

<p>“Come with me now.”</p>

<p>They were going until they came to a great river.
Then the old man said:</p>

<p>“Go on my back, and I’ll swim across the river with
you; but if you see a great bird coming, kill him, or we
shall be lost.”</p>

<p>Then the king’s son got on the old man’s back, and
the old man began swimming. When they were in the
middle of the river the king’s son saw a great eagle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
coming, and his gob (beak) open. The king’s son drew
the loop and wounded the eagle.</p>

<p>“Did you strike him?” said the old man.</p>

<p>“I struck him,” said the king’s son; “but here he
comes again.”</p>

<p>He drew the loop the second time and the eagle fell
dead.</p>

<p>When they came to the land, the old man said:</p>

<p>“We are on the island of the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan.
The queen is asleep, and she will not waken
for a day and a year. She never goes to sleep but once
in seven years. There is a lion and a monster (uillphéist)
watching at the gate of the well, but they go to sleep
at the same time with the queen, and you will have no
difficulty in going to the well. Here are two bottles for
you; fill one of them for yourself, and the other for me,
and it will make a young man of me.”</p>

<p>The king’s son went off, and when he came as far as
the castle he saw the lion and the monster sleeping on
each side of the gate. Then he saw a great wheel
throwing up water out of the well, and he went and
filled the two bottles, and he was coming back when he
saw a shining light in the castle. He looked in through
the window and saw a great table. There was a loaf of
bread, with a knife, a bottle, and a glass on it. He filled
the glass, but he did not diminish the bottle. He observed
that there was a writing on the bottle and on the loaf; and
he read on the bottle: “Water For the World,” and on the
loaf: “Bread For the World.” He cut a piece off the loaf,
but it only grew bigger.</p>

<p>“My grief! that we haven’t that loaf and that bottle
at home,” said the king’s son, “and there’d be neither
hunger nor thirst on the poor people.”</p>

<p>Then he went into a great chamber, and he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
queen and eleven waiting-maids asleep, and a sword of
light hung above the head of the queen. It was it that
was giving light to the whole castle.</p>

<p>When he saw the queen, he said to himself: “It’s a
pity to leave that pretty mouth without kissing it.” He
kissed the queen, and she never awoke; and after that
he did the same to the eleven maidens. Then he got
the sword, the bottle, and the loaf, and came to the old
man, but he never told him that he had those things.</p>

<p>“How did you get on?” said the old man.</p>

<p>“I got the thing I was in search of,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>“Did you see any marvel since you left me?” said the
old man.</p>

<p>The king’s son told him that he had seen a wonderful
loaf, bottle, and sword.</p>

<p>“You did not touch them?” said the old man; “shun
them, for they would bring trouble on you. Come on
my back now till I bring you across the river.”</p>

<p>When they went to the house of the old man, he put
water out of the bottle on himself, and made a young
man of himself. Then he said to the king’s son:</p>

<p>“My sisters and myself are now free from enchantment,
and they are young women again.”</p>

<p>The king’s son remained there until most part of the
year and day were gone. Then he began the journey
home; but, my grief, he had not the little nag with him.
He walked the first day until the darkness of the night
was coming on. He saw a large house. He went to
the door, struck it, and the man of the house came out
to him.</p>

<p>“Can you give me lodgings?” said he.</p>

<p>“I can,” said the man of the house, “only I have no
light to light you.”</p>

<p>“I have a light myself,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>He went in then, drew the sword, and gave a fine
light to them all, and to everybody that was in the
island. They then gave him a good supper, and he
went to sleep. When he was going away in the morning,
the man of the house asked him for the honour of
God, to leave the sword with them.</p>

<p>“Since you asked for it in the honour of God, you
must have it,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>He walked the second day till the darkness was
coming. He went to another great house, beat the
door, and it was not long till the woman of the house
came to him, and he asked lodgings of her. The man
of the house came and said:</p>

<p>“I can give you that; but I have not a drop of water
to dress food for you.”</p>

<p>“I have plenty of water myself,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>He went in, drew out the bottle, and there was not a
vessel in the house he did not fill, and still the bottle was
full. Then a supper was dressed for him, and when he
ate and drank his enough, he went to sleep. In the
morning, when he was going, the woman asked of him, in
the honour of God, to leave them the bottle.</p>

<p>“Since it has chanced that you ask it for the honour
of God,” said the king’s son, “I cannot refuse you, for my
mother put me under <i>gassa</i> (mystic obligations), before
she died, never, if I could, to refuse anything that a
person would ask of me for the honour of God.”</p>

<p>Then he left the bottle to them.</p>

<p>He walked the third day until darkness was coming,
and he reached a great house on the side of the road.
He struck the door; the man of the house came out, and
he asked lodgings of him.</p>

<p>“I can give you that, and welcome,” said the man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
“but I’m grieved that I have not a morsel of bread for you.”</p>

<p>“I have plenty of bread myself,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>He went in, got a knife, and began cutting the loaf,
until the table was filled with pieces of bread, and yet
the loaf was as big as it was when he began. Then
they prepared a supper for him, and when he ate his
enough, he went to sleep. When he was departing in
the morning, they asked of him, for the honour of God,
to leave the loaf with them, and he left it with them.</p>

<p>The three things were now gone from him.</p>

<p>He walked the fourth day until he came to a great
river, and he had no way to get across it. He went
upon his knees, and asked of God to send him help.
After half a minute, he saw the beautiful woman he saw
the day he left the house of the first hag. When she
came near him, she said: “Son of the king of the castle
of Bwee-sounnee, has it succeeded with you?”</p>

<p>“I got the thing I went in search of,” said the king’s
son; “but I do not know how I shall pass over this
river.”</p>

<p>She drew out a thimble and said: “Bad is the day I
would see your father’s son without a boat.”</p>

<p>Then she threw the thimble into the river, and made
a splendid boat of it.</p>

<p>“Get into that boat now,” said she; “and when you
will come to the other side, there will be a steed before
you to bring you as far as the cross-road, where you left
your brothers.”</p>

<p>The king’s son stepped into the boat, and it was not
long until he was at the other side, and there he found
a white steed before him. He went riding on it, and it
went off as swiftly as the wind. At about twelve o’clock
on that day, he was at the cross-roads. The king’s son
looked round him, and he did not see his brothers, nor
any stone set up, and he said to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> “perhaps they
are at the inn.” He went there, and found Art and
Nart, and they two-thirds drunk.</p>

<p>They asked him how he went on since he left them.</p>

<p>“I have found out the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan, and
I have the bottle of water,” said Cart.</p>

<p>Nart and Art were filled with jealousy, and they said
one to the other: “It’s a great shame that the youngest
son should have the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“We’ll kill him, and bring the bottle of water to my
father,” said Nart; “and we’ll say that it was ourselves
who went to the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan.”</p>

<p>“I’m not with you there,” said Art; “but we’ll set
him drunk, and we’ll take the bottle of (from) him. My
father will believe me and you, before he’ll believe our
brother, because he has an idea that there’s nothing in
him but a half <i>omadawn</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then,” he said to Cart, “since it has happened that
we have come home safe and sound we’ll have a drink
before we go home.”</p>

<p>They called for a quart of whiskey, and they made
Cart drink the most of it, and he fell drunk. Then
they took the bottle of water from him, went home themselves,
and gave it to the king. He put a drop of the
water on his foot, and it made him as well as ever he
was.</p>

<p>Then they told him that they had great trouble to get
the bottle of water; that they had to fight giants, and
to go through great dangers.</p>

<p>“Did ye see Cart on your road?” said the king.</p>

<p>“He never went farther than the inn, since he left
us,” said they; “and he’s in it now, blind drunk.”</p>

<p>“There never was any good in him,” said the king;
“but I cannot leave him there.”</p>

<p>Then he sent six men to the inn, and they carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Cart home. When he came to himself, the king made
him into a servant to do all the dirty jobs about the castle.</p>

<p>When a year and a day had gone by, the queen of the
Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan and her waiting-maidens
woke up and the queen found a young son by her side,
and the eleven maidens the same.</p>

<p>There was great anger on the queen, and she sent for
the lion and the monster, and asked them what was
become of the eagle that she left in charge of the castle.</p>

<p>“He must be dead, or he’d be here now, when you
woke up,” said they.</p>

<p>“I’m destroyed, myself, and the waiting-maidens
ruined,” said the queen; “and I never will stop till I find
out the father of my son.”</p>

<p>Then she got ready her enchanted coach, and two
fawns under it. She was going till she came to the first
house where the king’s son got lodging, and she asked
was there any stranger there lately. The man of the
house said there was.</p>

<p>“Yes!” said the queen, “and he left the sword of light
behind him; it is mine, and if you do not give it to me
quickly I will throw your house upside down.”</p>

<p>They gave her the sword, and she went on till she
came to the second house, in which he had got lodging,
and she asked was there any stranger there lately. They
said that there was. “Yes,” said she, “and he left a
bottle after him. Give it to me quickly, or I’ll throw the
house on ye.”</p>

<p>They gave her the bottle, and she went till she came
to the third house, and she asked was there any stranger
there lately. They said there was.</p>

<p>“Yes!” said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> “and he left the loaf of lasting
bread after him. That belongs to me, and if ye don’t
give it to me quickly I will kill ye all.”</p>

<p>She got the loaf, and she was going, and never
stopped till she came to the castle of Bwee-Sounee. She
pulled the <i>cooalya-coric</i>, pole of combat, and the king came
out.</p>

<p>“Have you any son?” said the queen.</p>

<p>“I have,” said the king.</p>

<p>“Send him out here till I see him,” said she.</p>

<p>The king sent out Art, and she asked him: “Were you
at the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan?”</p>

<p>“I was,” said Art.</p>

<p>“And are you the father of my son?” said she.</p>

<p>“I believe I am,” said Art.</p>

<p>“I will know that soon,” said she.</p>

<p>Then she drew two hairs out of her head, flung them
against the wall, and they were made into a ladder that
went up to the top of the castle. Then she said to Art:
“If you were at the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan, you can
go up to the top of that ladder.”</p>

<p>Art went up half way, then he fell, and his thigh was
broken.</p>

<p>“You were never at the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan,”
said the queen.</p>

<p>Then she asked the king: “Have you any other son?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said the king.</p>

<p>“Bring him out,” said the queen.</p>

<p>Nart came out, and she asked him: “Were you ever
at the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan?”</p>

<p>“I was,” said Nart.</p>

<p>“If you were, go up to the top of that ladder,” said
the queen.</p>

<p>He began going up, but he had not gone far till he
fell and broke his foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“You were not at the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan,” said
the queen.</p>

<p>Then she asked the king if he had any other son, and
the king said he had. “But,” said he, “it’s a half fool
he is, that never left home.”</p>

<p>“Bring him here,” said the queen.</p>

<p>When Cart came, she asked him: “Were you at the
Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan?”</p>

<p>“I was,” said Cart, “and I saw you there.”</p>

<p>“Go up to the top of that ladder,” said the queen.</p>

<p>Cart went up like a cat, and when he came down she
said: “You are the man who was at the Well of D’yerree-in-Dowan,
and you are the father of my son.”</p>

<p>Then Cart told the trick his brothers played on him,
and the queen was going to slay them, until Cart
asked pardon for them. Then the king said that Cart
must get the kingdom.</p>

<p>Then the father dressed him out and put a chain of
gold beneath his neck, and he got into the coach along
with the queen, and they departed to the Well of
D’yerree-in-Dowan.</p>

<p>The waiting-maidens gave a great welcome to the
king’s son, and they all of them came to him, each one
asking him to marry herself.</p>

<p>He remained there for one-and-twenty years, until the
queen died, and then he brought back with him his
twelve sons, and came home to Galway. Each of them
married a wife, and it is from them that the twelve tribes
of Galway are descended.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_IX">THE COURT OF CRINNAWN.</h2>

<p>A long time ago there came a lot of gentlemen to a
river which is between the County Mee-òh (Mayo)
and Roscommon, and they chose out a nice place
for themselves on the brink of a river, and set up a
court on it. Nobody at all in the little villages round
about knew from what place these gentlemen came.
MacDonnell was the name that was on them. The
neighbours were for a long time without making friendship
with them, until there came a great plague, and
the people were getting death in their hundreds.</p>

<p>One day there was the only son of a poor widow
dying from the destructive plague, and she had not a
drop of milk to wet his tongue. She went to the court,
and they asked her what she was looking for. She
told them that the one son she had was dying of the
plague and that she had not a drop of milk to wet his
tongue.</p>

<p>“Hard is your case,” says a lady that was in the court
to her. “I will give you milk and healing, and your son
will be as well at the end of an hour as ever he was.”
Then she gave her a tin can, and said: “Go home now,
this can will never be empty as long as you or your son is
alive, if you keep the secret without telling anybody that
you got it here. When you will go home put a morsel of
the Mary’s shamrock (four-leaved shamrock?) in the milk
and give it to your son.”</p>

<p>The widow went home. She put a bit of four-leaved
shamrock in the milk, and gave it to her son to drink, and
he rose up at the end of an hour as well as ever he was.
Then the woman went through the villages round about
with the can, and there was no one at all to whom she
gave a drink that was not healed at the end of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long till the fame of Maurya nee Keerachawn
(Mary Kerrigan), that was the name of the widow, went
through the country, and it was not long till she had the
full of the bag of gold and silver.</p>

<p>One day Mary went to a <i>pattern</i> at Cultya Bronks,
drank too much, fell on drunkenness, and let out the
secret.</p>

<p>There came the heavy sleep of drunkenness on her,
and when she awoke the can was gone. There was so
much grief on her that she drowned herself in a place
called Pull Bawn (the White Hole), within a mile of
Cultya Bronks.</p>

<p>Everybody thought now that they had the can of
healing to get at the Court of Crinnawn if they would go
there. In the morning, the day on the morrow, there
went plenty of people to the court, and they found every
one who was in it dead. The shout went out, and the
hundreds of people gathered together, but no man could
go in, for the court was filled with smoke; and lightning
and thunder coming out of it.</p>

<p>They sent a message for the priest, who was in
Ballaghadereen, but he said: “It is not in my parish,
and I won’t have anything to do with it.” That night
the people saw a great light in the court, and there was
very great fear on them. The day on the morrow they
sent word to the priest of Lisahull, but he would not
come, as the place was not in his parish. Word was sent
to the priest of Kilmovee, then, but he had the same
excuse.</p>

<p>There were a lot of poor friars in Cultya Mawn, and
when they heard the story they went to the court without
a person with them but themselves.</p>

<p>When they went in they began saying prayers, but
they saw no corpse. After a time the smoke went, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
lightning and thunder ceased, a door opened, and there
came out a great man. The friars noticed that he had
only one eye, and that it was in his forehead.</p>

<p>“In the name of God, who are you?” said a man of
the friars.</p>

<p>“I am Crinnawn, son of Belore, of the Evil Eye. Let
there be no fear on ye, I shall do ye no damage, for ye
are courageous, good men. The people who were here
are gone to eternal rest, body and soul. I know that ye
are poor, and that there are plenty of poor people round
about ye. Here are two purses for ye, one of them for
yourselves, and the other one to divide upon the poor;
and when all that will be spent, do ye come again.
Not of this world am I, but I shall do no damage to
anyone unless he does it to me first, and do ye keep from
me.”</p>

<p>Then he gave them two purses, and said: “Go now on
your good work.” The friars went home; they gathered
the poor people and they divided the money on them.
The people questioned them as to what it was they saw in
the court. “It is a secret each thing we saw in the court,
and it is our advice to ye not to go near the court, and
no harm will come upon ye.”</p>

<p>The priests were covetous when they heard that the
friars got plenty of money in the court, and the three of
them went there with the hope that they would get some
as the friars got it.</p>

<p>When they went in they began crying aloud: “Is there
any person here? is there any person here?” Crinnawn
came out of a chamber and asked: “What are ye looking
for?” “We came to make friendship with you,” said
the priests. “I thought that priests were not given to
telling lies,” said Crinnawn;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> “ye came with a hope
that ye would get money as the poor friars got. Ye
were afraid to come when the people sent for ye, and now
ye will not get a keenogue (mite?) from me, for ye are not
worth it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that we have power to banish you
out of this place,” said the priests, “and we will make use
of that power unless you will be more civil than you
are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for your power,” said Crinnawn, “I have
more power myself than all the priests that are in
Ireland.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie you’re speaking,” said the priests.</p>

<p>“Ye will see a small share of my power to-night,” said
Crinnawn; “I will not leave a wattle over your heads
that I will not sweep into yonder river, and I could kill
ye with the sight of my eye, if I chose. Ye will find the
roofs of your houses in the river to-morrow morning.
Now put no other questions on me, and threaten me no
more, or it will be worse for ye.”</p>

<p>There came fear on the priests, and they went home;
but they did not believe that their houses would be
without a roof before morning.</p>

<p>About midnight, that night, there came a blast of wind
under the roof of the houses of the priests, and it swept
them into the river forenent the court. There was not a
bone of the priests but was shaken with terror, and they
had to get shelter in the houses of the neighbours till
morning.</p>

<p>In the morning, the day on the morrow, the priests
came to the river opposite the court, and they saw the
roofs that were on all their houses swimming in the water.
They sent for the friars, and asked them to go to
Crinnawn and proclaim a peace, and say to him that they
would put no more trouble on him. The friars went to
the court, and Crinnawn welcomed them, and asked them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
what they were seeking. “We come from the priests to
proclaim a peace on you, they will trouble you no
more.” “That is well for them,” said Crinnawn, “come
with me now until ye see me putting back the roofs
of the houses.” They went with him as far as the river,
and then he blew a blast out of each nostril. The roofs
of the houses rose up as well as they were when they
were first put on. There was wonder on the priests, and
they said: “The power of enchantment is not yet dead,
nor banished out of the country yet.” From that day
out neither priest nor anyone else would go near the
Court of Crinnawn.</p>

<p>A year after the death of Mary Kerrigan, there was a
pattern in Cultya Bronks. There were plenty of young
men gathered in it, and amongst them was Paudyeen,
the son of Mary Kerrigan. They drank whiskey till
they were in madness. When they were going home,
Paudyeen O’Kerrigan said: “There is money in plenty
in the court up there, and if ye have courage we can get
it.” As the drink was in them, twelve of them said:
“We have courage, and we will go to the court.” When
they came to the door, Paudyeen O’Kerrigan said:
“Open the door, or we will break it.” Crinnawn came
out and said: “Unless ye go home I will put a month’s
sleep on ye.” They thought to get a hold of Crinnawn,
but he put a blast of wind out of his two nostrils that
swept the young men to a <i>lis</i> (old circular rath) called
Lisdrumneal, and put a heavy sleep on them, and a big
cloud over them, and there is no name on the place from
that out, but Lis-trum-nail (the fort of the heavy
cloud).</p>

<p>On the morning, the day on the morrow, the young
men were not to be found either backwards or forwards,
and there was great grief amongst the people. That day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
went by without any account from the young men.
People said that it was Crinnawn that killed them, for
some saw them going to the court. The fathers and
mothers of the young men went to the friars, and prayed
them to go to Crinnawn and to find out from him where
the young men were, dead or alive.</p>

<p>They went to Crinnawn, and Crinnawn told them the
trick the young men thought to do on him, and the thing
he did with them. “If it be your will, bestow forgiveness
on them this time,” said the friars; “they were mad with
whiskey, and they won’t be guilty again.” “On account
of ye to ask it of me, I will loose them this time; but if
they come again, I will put a sleep of seven years on
them. Come with me now till you see them.”</p>

<p>“It’s bad walkers, we are,” said the friars, “we would
be a long time going to the place where they are.”</p>

<p>“Ye won’t be two minutes going to it,” said Crinnawn,
“and ye will be back at home in the same
time.”</p>

<p>Then he brought them out, and put a blast of wind out
of his mouth, and swept them to Lisdrumneal, and he
himself was there as soon as they.</p>

<p>They saw the twelve young men asleep under a cloud
in the <i>lis</i>, and there was great wonder on them. “Now,”
said Crinnawn, “I will send them home.” He blew upon
them, and they rose up like birds in the air, and it was
not long until each one of them was at home, and the
friars as well, and you may be certain that they did not
go to the Court of Crinnawn any more.</p>

<p>Crinnawn was living in the court years after that.
One day the friars went on a visit to him, but he was
not to be found. People say that the friars got great
riches after Crinnawn. At the end of a period of time
the roof fell off the court, as everyone was afraid to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and live in it. During many years after that, people
would go round about a mile, before they would go near
the old court. There is only a portion of the walls to
be found now; but there is no name on the old court
from that day till this day, but Coort a Chrinnawn
(Crinnawn’s Court).</p>

<h2 id="TALE_X">NEIL O’CARREE.</h2>

<p>There was no nicety about him. He said to his wife
that he would go to the forge to get a doctoring instrument.
He went to the forge the next day. “Where are
you going to to-day?” said the smith. “I am going till
you make me an instrument for doctoring.” “What is
the instrument I shall make you?” “Make a <i>crumskeen</i>
and a <i>galskeen</i>” (crooked knife and white knife?). The
smith made that for him. He came home.</p>

<p>When the day came—the day on the morrow—Neil
O’Carree rose up. He made ready to be going as a
doctor. He went. He was walking away. A red lad
met him on the side of the high road. He saluted Neil
O’Carree; Neil saluted him. “Where are you going?”
says the red man. “I am going till I be my (<i>i.e.</i>, a)
doctor.“ ”It’s a good trade,” says the red man, “’twere
best for you to hire me.” “What’s the wages you’ll be
looking for?” says Neil. “Half of what we shall earn till
we shall be back again on this ground.” “I’ll give you
that,” says Neil. The couple walked on.</p>

<p>“There’s a king’s daughter,” says the red man, “with
the (<i>i.e.</i>, near to) death; we will go as far as her, till we
see will we heal her.” They went as far as the gate.
The porter came to them. He asked them where were
they going. They said that it was coming to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
king’s daughter they were, to see would they do her good.
The king desired to let them in. They went in.</p>

<p>They went to the place where the girl was lying. The
red man went and took hold of her pulse. He said
that if his master should get the price of his labour he
would heal her. The king said that he would give his
master whatever he should award himself. He said, “if
he had the room to himself and his master, that it would
be better.” The king said he should have it.</p>

<p>He desired to bring down to him a skillet (little pot) of
water. He put the skillet on the fire. He asked Neil
O’Carree: “Where is the doctoring instrument?” “Here
they are,” says Neil, “a crumskeen and a galskeen.”</p>

<p>He put the crumskeen on the neck of the girl. He
took the head off her. He drew a green herb out of his
pocket. He rubbed it to the neck. There did not come
one drop of blood. He threw the head into the skillet.
He knocked a boil out of it. He seized hold on the two
ears. He took it out of the skillet. He struck it down
on the neck. The head stuck as well as ever it was.
“How do you feel yourself now?” “I am as well as ever
I was,” said the king’s daughter.</p>

<p>The big man shouted. The king came down. There
was great joy on him. He would not let them go away
for three days. When they were going he brought down
a bag of money. He poured it out on the table. He
asked of Neil O’Carree had he enough there. Neil said
he had, and more than enough, that they would take but
the half. The king desired them not to spare the money.</p>

<p>“There’s the daughter of another king waiting for us to
go and look at her.” They bade farewell to the king and
they went there.</p>

<p>They went looking at her. They went to the place
where she was lying, looking at her in her bed, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the same way this one was healed. The king was
grateful, and he said he did not mind how much money
Neil should take of him. He gave him three hundred
pounds of money. They went then, drawing on home.
“There’s a king’s son in such and such a place,” said the
red man, “but we won’t go to him, we will go home with
what we have.”</p>

<p>They were drawing on home. The king (had) bestowed
half a score of heifers on them, to bring home with them.
They were walking away. When they were in the place
where Neil O’Carree hired the red man, “I think,” says
the red man, “that this is the place I met you the first
time.” “I think it is,” says Neil O’Carree. “Musha,
how shall we divide the money?” “Two halves,” says
the red man, “that’s the bargain was in it.” “I think it a
great deal to give you a half,” says Neil O’Carree, “a
third is big enough for you; I have a crumskeen and a
galskeen (says Neil) and you have nothing.” “I won’t
take anything,” said the red man, “unless I get the half.”
They fell out about the money. The red man went and
he left him.</p>

<p>Neil O’Carree was drawing home, riding on his beast.
He was driving his share of cattle. The day came hot.
The cattle went capering backwards and forwards. Neil
O’Carree was controlling them. When he would have
one or two caught the rest would be off when he used to
come back. He tied his garrawn (gelding) to a bit of a
tree. He was a-catching the cattle. At the last they
were all off and away. He did not know where they
went. He returned back to the place where he left his
garrawn and his money. Neither the garrawn nor the
money were to be got. He did not know then what he
should do. He thought he would go to the house of the
king whose son was ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He went along, drawing towards the house of the king.
He went looking on the lad in the place where he was
lying. He took a hold of his pulse. He said he thought
he would heal him. “If you heal him,” said the king, “I
will give you three hundred pounds.” “If I were to get
the room to myself, for a little,” says he. The king said
that he should get that. He called down for a skillet of
water. He put the skillet on the fire. He drew his
crumskeen. He went to take the head off him as he
saw the red man a-doing. He was a-sawing at the head,
and it did not come with him to cut it off the neck.
The blood was coming. He took the head off him at
last. He threw it into the skillet. He knocked a boil
out of it. When he considered the head to be boiled
enough he made an attempt on the skillet. He got a
hold of the two ears. The head fell in <i>gliggar</i> (a gurgling
mass?), and the two ears came with him. The blood was
coming greatly. It was going down, and out of the
door of the room. When the king saw it going down he
knew that his son was dead. He desired to open the
door. Neil O’Carree would not open the door. They
broke the door. The man was dead. The floor was
full of blood. They seized Neil O’Carree. He was to
hang the next day. They gathered a guard till they
should carry him to the place where he was to hang.
They went the next day with him. They were walking
away, drawing towards the tree where he should be
hanged. They stopped his screaming. They see a man
stripped making a running race. When they saw him
there was a fog of water round him with all he was running.
When he came as far as them (he cried),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> “what
are ye doing to my master?” “If this man is your
master, deny him, or you’ll get the same treatment.”
“It’s I that it’s right should suffer; it’s I who made the
delay. He sent me for medicine, and I did not come in
time, loose my master, perhaps he would heal the king’s
son yet.”</p>

<p>They loosed him. They came to the king’s house.
The red man went to the place where the dead man was.
He began gathering the bones that were in the skillet.
He gathered them all but only the two ears.</p>

<p>“What did you do with the ears?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Neil O’Carree, “I was so much
frightened.”</p>

<p>The red man got the ears. He put them all together.
He drew a green herb out of his pocket. He rubbed it
round on the head. The skin grew on it, and the hair, as
well as ever it was. He put the head in the skillet then.
He knocked a boil out of it. He put the head back on
the neck as well as ever it was. The king’s son rose up in
the bed.</p>

<p>“How are you now?” says the red man.</p>

<p>“I am well,” says the king’s son, “but that I’m weak.”</p>

<p>The red man shouted again for the king. There was
great joy on the king when he saw his son alive. They
spent that night pleasantly.</p>

<p>The next day when they were going away, the king
counted out three hundred pounds. He gave it to Neil
O’Carree. He said to Neil that if he had not enough he
would give him more. Neil O’Carree said he had enough,
and that he would not take a penny more. He bade
farewell and left his blessing, and struck out, drawing
towards home.</p>

<p>When they saw that they were come to the place where
they fell out with one another, “I think,” says the red
man, “that this is the place where we differed before.”
“It is, exactly,” said Neil O’Carree. They sat down and
they divided the money. He gave a half to the red man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and he kept another half himself. The red man bade
him farewell, and he went. He was walking away for a
while. He returned back. “I am here back again,”
said the red man, “I took another thought, to leave all
your share of money with yourself. You yourself were
open-handed. Do you mind the day you were going by
past the churchyard. There were four inside in the
churchyard, and a body with them in a coffin. There
were a pair of them seeking to bury the body. There
were debts on the body (<i>i.e.</i>, it owed debts). The two men
who had the debts on it (<i>i.e.</i>, to whom it owed the debts),
they were not satisfied for the body to be buried. They
were arguing. You were listening to them. You went
in. You asked how much they had on the body (<i>i.e.</i>, how
were they owed by the body). The two men said that
they had a pound on the body, and that they were not
willing the body to be buried, until the people who were
carrying it would promise to pay a portion of the debts.
You said, ‘I have ten shillings, and I’ll give it to ye,
and let the body be buried.’ You gave the ten shillings,
and the corpse was buried. It’s I who was in the coffin
that day. When I saw you going a-doctoring, I knew
that you would not do the business. When I saw you
in a hobble, I came to you to save you. I bestow the
money on you all entirely. You shall not see me until
the last day, go home now. Don’t do a single day’s
doctoring as long as you’ll be alive. It’s short you’ll
walk until you get your share of cattle and your garrawn.”</p>

<p>Neil went, drawing towards home. Not far did he walk
till his share of cattle and his nag met him. He went
home and the whole with him. There is not a single day
since that himself and his wife are not thriving on it.</p>

<p>I got the ford, they the stepping stones. They were
drowned, and I came safe.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_XI">TRUNK-WITHOUT-HEAD.</h2>

<p>Long ago there was a widow woman living in the County
Galway, and two sons with her, whose names were
Dermod and Donal. Dermod was the eldest son, and he
was the master over the house. They were large farmers,
and they got a summons from the landlord to come and
pay him a year’s rent. They had not much money in
the house, and Dermod said to Donal, “bring a load of
oats to Galway, and sell it.” Donal got ready a load, put
two horses under the cart, and went to Galway. He sold
the oats, and got a good price for it. When he was
coming home, he stopped at the half-way house, as was
his custom, to have a drink himself, and to give a drink
and oats to the horses.</p>

<p>When he went in to get a drink for himself, he saw two
boys playing cards. He looked at them for a while, and
one of them said: “Will you have a game?” Donal
began playing, and he did not stop till he lost every
penny of the price of the oats. “What will I do now?”
says Donal to himself, “Dermod will kill me. Anyhow,
I’ll go home and tell the truth.”</p>

<p>When he came home, Dermod asked him: “Did you
sell the oats?” “I sold, and got a good price for it,”
says Donal. “Give me the money,” says Dermod. “I
haven’t it,” says Donal; “I lost every penny of it playing
cards at the house half-way.” “My curse, and the curse
of the four-and-twenty men on you,” says Dermod. He
went and told the mother the trick Donal did. “Give
him his pardon this time,” says the mother, “and he won’t
do it again.” “You must sell another load to-morrow,”
says Dermod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> “and if you lose the price, don’t come
here.”</p>

<p>On the morning, the day on the morrow, Donal put
another load on the cart, and he went to Galway. He
sold the oats, and got a good price for it. When he was
coming home, and near the half-way house, he said to
himself: “I will shut my eyes till I go past that house,
for fear there should be a temptation on me to go in.”
He shut his eyes; but when the horses came as far as
the inn, they stood, and would not go a step further, for
it was their custom to get oats and water in that place
every time they would be coming out of Galway. He
opened his eyes, gave oats and water to the horses, and
went in himself to put a coal in his pipe.</p>

<p>When he went in he saw the boys playing cards. They
asked him to play, and (said) that perhaps he might gain
all that he lost the day before. As there is a temptation
on the cards, Donal began playing, and he did not stop
until he lost every penny of all that he had. “There is
no good in my going home now,” says Donal; “I’ll
stake the horses and the cart against all I lost.” He
played again, and he lost the horses and the cart. Then
he did not know what he should do, but he thought and
said: “Unless I go home, my poor mother will be
anxious. I will go home and tell the truth to her. They
can but banish me.”</p>

<p>When he came home, Dermod asked him: “Did you
sell the oats? or where are the horses and the cart?” “I
lost the whole playing cards, and I would not come back
except to leave ye my blessing before I go.” “That you
may not ever come back, or a penny of your price,” said
Dermod, “and I don’t want your blessing.”</p>

<p>He left his blessing with his mother then, and he went
travelling, looking for service. When the darkness of
the night was coming, there was thirst and hunger on
him. He saw a poor man coming to him, and a bag on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his back. He recognised Donal, and said: “Donal,
what brought you here, or where are you going?” “I
don’t know you,” said Donal.</p>

<p>“It’s many’s the good night I spent in your father’s
house, may God have mercy upon him,” said the poor
man; “perhaps there’s hunger on you, and that you
would not be against eating something out of my bag?”</p>

<p>“It’s a friend that would give it to me,” says Donal.
Then the poor man gave him beef and bread, and when
he ate his enough, the poor man asked him: “Where are
you going to-night?”</p>

<p>“Musha, then, I don’t know,” says Donal.</p>

<p>“There is a gentleman in the big house up there, and
he gives lodging to anyone who comes to him after the
darkness of night, and I’m going to him,” says the poor
man.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I would get lodgings with you,” says Donal.
“I have no doubt of it,” says the poor man.</p>

<p>The pair went to the big house, and the poor man
knocked at the door, and the servant opened it. “I want
to see the master of this house,” says Donal.</p>

<p>The servant went, and the master came. “I am looking
for a night’s lodging,” said Donal.</p>

<p>“I will give ye that, if ye wait. Go up to the castle
there above, and I will be after ye, and if ye wait in it till
morning, each man of ye will get five score ten-penny
pieces, and ye will have plenty to eat and drink as well;
and a good bed to sleep on.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good offer,” said they; “we will go there.”</p>

<p>The pair came to the castle, went into a room, and put
down a fire. It was not long till the gentleman came,
bringing beef, mutton, and other things to them. “Come
with me now till I show ye the cellar, there’s plenty of
wine and ale in it, and ye can draw your enough.” When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he showed them the cellar, he went out, and he put a lock
on the door behind him.</p>

<p>Then Donal said to the poor man: “Put the things to
eat on the table, and I’ll go for the ale.” Then he got a
light, and a cruiskeen (jug), and went down into the cellar.
The first barrel he came to he stooped down to draw out
of it, when a voice said: “Stop, that barrel is mine.”
Donal looked up, and he saw a little man without a head,
with his two legs spread straddle-wise on a barrel.</p>

<p>“If it is yours,” says Donal, “I’ll go to another.” He
went to another; but when he stooped down to draw,
Trunk-without-head said: “That barrel is mine.”
“They’re not all yours,” says Donal, “I’ll go to another
one.” He went to another one; but when he began
drawing out of it, Trunk-without-head said: “That’s
mine.” “I don’t care,” said Donal, “I’ll fill my
cruiskeen.” He did that, and came up to the poor man;
but he did not tell him that he saw Trunk-without-head.
Then they began eating and drinking till the jug was
empty. Then said Donal: “It’s your turn to go down
and fill the jug.” The poor man got the candle and the
cruiskeen, and went down into the cellar. He began
drawing out of a barrel, when he heard a voice saying:
“That barrel is mine.” He looked up, and when he saw
Trunk-without-head, he let cruiskeen and candle fall, and
off and away with him to Donal. “Oh! it’s little but I’m
dead,” says the poor man; “I saw a man without a head,
and his two legs spread out on the barrel, and he said it
was his.” “He would not do you any harm,” said Donal,
“he was there when I went down; get up and bring me
the jug and the candle.” “Oh, I wouldn’t go down again
if I were to get Ireland without a division,” says the poor
man. Donal went down, and he brought up the jug filled.
“Did you see Trunk-without-head?” says the poor man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
“I did,” says Donal; “but he did not do me any
harm.”</p>

<p>They were drinking till they were half drunk, then said
Donal: “It’s time for us to be going to sleep, what place
would you like best, the outside of the bed, or next the
wall?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go next the wall,” said the poor man. They went
to bed leaving the candle lit.</p>

<p>They were not long in bed till they saw three men
coming in, and a bladder (football) with them. They
began beating <i>bayrees</i> (playing at ball) on the floor; but
there were two of them against one. Donal said to the
poor man: “It is not right for two to be against one,”
and with that he leaped out and began helping the weak
side, and he without a thread on him. Then they began
laughing, and walked out.</p>

<p>Donal went to bed again, and he was not long there till
there came in a piper playing sweet music. “Rise up,”
says Donal, “until we have a dance; it’s a great pity to
let good music go to loss.” “For your life, don’t stir,”
says the poor man.</p>

<p>Donal gave a leap out of the bed, and he fell to dancing
till he was tired. Then the piper began laughing, and
walked out.</p>

<p>Donal went to bed again; but he was not long there
till there walked in two men, carrying a coffin. They
left it down on the floor, and they walked out. “I don’t
know who’s in the coffin, or whether it’s for us it’s meant,”
said Donal; “I’ll go till I see.” He gave a leap out,
raised the board of the coffin, and found a dead man in
it. “By my conscience, it’s the cold place you have,”
says Donal; “if you were able to rise up, and sit at the
fire, you would be better.” The dead man rose up and
warmed himself. Then said Donal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> “the bed is wide
enough for three.” Donal went in the middle, the poor
man next the wall, and the dead man on the outside. It
was not long until the dead man began bruising Donal,
and Donal bruising in on the poor man, until he was all
as one as dead, and he had to give a leap out through
the window, and to leave Donal and the dead man there.
The dead man was crushing Donal then until he nearly
put him out through the wall.</p>

<p>“Destruction on you,” said Donal, then; “it’s you’re
the ungrateful man; I let you out of the coffin; I gave
you a heat at the fire, and a share of my bed; and now
you won’t keep quiet; but I’ll put you out of the bed.”
Then the dead man spoke, and said: “You are a valiant
man, and it stood you upon<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> to be so, or you would be
dead.” “Who would kill me?” said Donal. “I,” says
the dead man; “there never came any one here this
twenty years back, that I did not kill. Do you know the
man who paid you for remaining here?” “He was a
gentleman,” said Donal. “He is my son,” said the dead
man, “and he thinks that you will be dead in the
morning; but come with me now.”</p>

<p>The dead man took him down into the cellar, and
showed him a great flag. “Lift that flag. There are
three pots under it, and they filled with gold. It is on
account of the gold they killed me; but they did not get
the gold. Let yourself have a pot, and a pot for my son,
and the other one—divide it on the poor people.” Then
he opened a door in the wall, and drew out a paper, and
said to Donal:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> “Give this to my son, and tell him that
it was the butler who killed me, for my share of gold. I
can get no rest until he’ll be hanged; and if there is a
witness wanting I will come behind you in the court
without a head on me, so that everybody can see me.
When he will be hanged, you will marry my son’s
daughter, and come to live in this castle. Let you have
no fear about me, for I shall have gone to eternal rest.
Farewell now.”</p>

<p>Donal went to sleep, and he did not awake till the
gentleman came in the morning, and he asked him did he
sleep well, or where did the old man whom he left with
him go? “I will tell you that another time; I have a
long story to tell you first.” “Come to my house with
me,” says the gentleman.</p>

<p>When they were going to the house, whom should they
see coming out of the bushes, but the poor man without
a thread on him, more than the night he was born, and he
shaking with the cold. The gentleman got him his
clothes, gave him his wages, and off for ever with him.</p>

<p>Donal went to the gentleman’s house, and when he ate
and drank his enough, he said: “I have a story to tell
you.” Then he told him everything that happened to
him the night before, until he came as far as the part
about the gold. “Come with me till I see the gold,” said
the gentleman. He went to the castle, he lifted the flag,
and when he saw the gold, he said: “I know now that
the story is true.”</p>

<p>When he got the entire information from Donal, he got
a warrant against the butler; but concealed the crime it
was for. When the butler was brought before the judge,
Donal was there, and gave witness. Then the judge read
out of his papers, and said: “I cannot find this man
guilty without more evidence.”</p>

<p>“I am here,” said Trunk-without-head, coming behind
Donal. When the butler saw him, he said to the judge:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
“Go no farther, I am guilty; I killed the man, and his
head is under the hearth-stone in his own room.” Then
the judge gave order to hang the butler, and Trunk-without-head
went away.</p>

<p>The day on the morrow, Donal was married to the
gentleman’s daughter, and got a great fortune with her,
and went to live in the castle.</p>

<p>A short time after this, he got ready his coach and
went on a visit to his mother.</p>

<p>When Dermod saw the coach coming, he did not know
who the great man was who was in it. The mother
came out and ran to him, saying: “Are you not my own
Donal, the love of my heart you are? I was praying for
you since you went.” Then Dermod asked pardon of
him, and got it. Then Donal gave him a purse of gold,
saying at the same time: “There’s the price of the two
loads of oats, of the horses, and of the cart.” Then he
said to his mother: “You ought to come home with me.
I have a fine castle without anybody in it but my wife
and the servants.” “I will go with you,” said the mother;
“and I will remain with you till I die.”</p>

<p>Donal took his mother home, and they spent a
prosperous life together in the castle.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_XII">THE HAGS OF THE LONG TEETH.</h2>

<p>Long ago, in the old time, there came a party of gentlemen
from Dublin to Loch Glynn a-hunting and a-fishing.
They put up in the priest’s house, as there was no inn in
the little village.</p>

<p>The first day they went a-hunting, they went into the
Wood of Driminuch, and it was not long till they routed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a hare. They fired many a ball after him, but they could
not bring him down. They followed him till they saw
him going into a little house in the wood.</p>

<p>When they came to the door, they saw a great black
dog, and he would not let them in.</p>

<p>“Put a ball through the beggar,” said a man of them.
He let fly a ball, but the dog caught it in his mouth,
chewed it, and flung it on the ground. They fired another
ball, and another, but the dog did the same thing with
them. Then he began barking as loud as he could, and it
was not long till there came out a hag, and every tooth in
her head as long as the tongs. “What are you doing to
my pup?” says the hag.</p>

<p>“A hare went into your house, and this dog won’t let
us in after him,” says a man of the hunters.</p>

<p>“Lie down, pup,” said the hag. Then she said: “Ye
can come in if ye wish.” The hunters were afraid to go
in, but a man of them asked: “Is there any person in
the house with you?”</p>

<p>“There are six sisters,” said the old woman. “We
should like to see them,” said the hunters. No sooner had
he said the word than the six old women came out, and
each of them with teeth as long as the other. Such a sight
the hunters had never seen before.</p>

<p>They went through the wood then, and they saw seven
vultures on one tree, and they screeching. The hunters
began cracking balls after them, but if they were in it ever
since they would never bring down one of them.</p>

<p>There came a gray old man to them and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> “Those
are the hags of the long tooth that are living in the little
house over there. Do ye not know that they are under
enchantment? They are there these hundreds of years,
and they have a dog that never lets in anyone to the
little house. They have a castle under the lake, and it
is often the people saw them making seven swans of
themselves, and going into the lake.”</p>

<p>When the hunters came home that evening they told
everything they heard and saw to the priest, but he did
not believe the story.</p>

<p>On the day on the morrow, the priest went with the
hunters, and when they came near the little house they
saw the big black dog at the door. The priest put his
conveniencies for blessing under his neck, and drew out
a book and began reading prayers. The big dog began
barking loudly. The hags came out, and when they saw
the priest they let a screech out of them that was heard
in every part of Ireland. When the priest was a while
reading, the hags made vultures of themselves and flew
up into a big tree that was over the house.</p>

<p>The priest began pressing in on the dog until he was
within a couple of feet of him.</p>

<p>The dog gave a leap up, struck the priest with its four
feet, and put him head over heels.</p>

<p>When the hunters took him up he was deaf and dumb,
and the dog did not move from the door.</p>

<p>They brought the priest home and sent for the bishop.
When he came and heard the story there was great grief
on him. The people gathered together and asked of him
to banish the hags of enchantment out of the wood. There
was fright and shame on him, and he did not know what
he would do, but he said to them: “I have no means of
banishing them till I go home, but I will come at the end
of a month and banish them.”</p>

<p>The priest was too badly hurt to say anything. The
big black dog was father of the hags, and his name was
Dermod O’Muloony. His own son killed him, because
he found him with his wife the day after their marriage,
and killed the sisters for fear they should tell on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>One night the bishop was in his chamber asleep, when
one of the hags of the long tooth opened the door and
came in. When the bishop wakened up he saw the hag
standing by the side of his bed. He was so much afraid
he was not able to speak a word until the hag spoke and
said to him: “Let there be no fear on you; I did not come
to do you harm, but to give you advice. You promised
the people of Loch Glynn that you would come to banish
the hags of the long tooth out of the wood of Driminuch.
If you come you will never go back alive.”</p>

<p>His talk came to the bishop, and he said: “I cannot
break my word.”</p>

<p>“We have only a year and a day to be in the wood,”
said the hag, “and you can put off the people until
then.”</p>

<p>“Why are ye in the woods as ye are?” says the bishop.</p>

<p>“Our brother killed us,” said the hag, “and when we
went before the arch-judge, there was judgment passed on
us, we to be as we are two hundred years. We have a
castle under the lake, and be in it every night. We are
suffering for the crime our father did.” Then she told
him the crime the father did.</p>

<p>“Hard is your case,” said the bishop, “but we must
put up with the will of the arch-judge, and I shall not
trouble ye.”</p>

<p>“You will get an account, when we are gone from the
wood,” said the hag. Then she went from him.</p>

<p>In the morning, the day on the morrow, the bishop
came to Loch Glynn. He sent out notice and gathered
the people. Then he said to them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> “It is the will of
the arch-king that the power of enchantment be not
banished for another year and a day, and ye must keep
out of the wood until then. It is a great wonder to me
that ye never saw the hags of enchantment till the hunters
came from Dublin.—It’s a pity they did not remain at
home.”</p>

<p>About a week after that the priest was one day by
himself in his chamber alone. The day was very fine
and the window was open. The robin of the red breast
came in and a little herb in its mouth. The priest
stretched out his hand, and she laid the herb down on it.
“Perhaps it was God sent me this herb,” said the priest
to himself, and he ate it. He had not eaten it one
moment till he was as well as ever he was, and he said:
“A thousand thanks to Him who has power stronger than
the power of enchantment.”</p>

<p>Then said the robin: “Do you remember the robin of
the broken foot you had, two years this last winter.”</p>

<p>“I remember her, indeed,” said the priest, “but she
went from me when the summer came.”</p>

<p>“I am the same robin, and but for the good you did
me I would not be alive now, and you would be deaf and
dumb throughout your life. Take my advice now, and
do not go near the hags of the long tooth any more, and
do not tell to any person living that I gave you the herb.”
Then she flew from him.</p>

<p>When the house-keeper came she wondered to find that
he had both his talk and his hearing. He sent word to the
bishop and he came to Loch Glynn. He asked the priest
how it was that he got better so suddenly. “It is a secret,”
said the priest, “but a certain friend gave me a little herb
and it cured me.”</p>

<p>Nothing else happened worth telling, till the year was
gone. One night after that the bishop was in his chamber
when the door opened, and the hag of the long tooth
walked in, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> “I come to give you notice that we
will be leaving the wood a week from to-day. I have one
thing to ask of you if you will do it for me.”</p>

<p>“If it is in my power, and it not to be against the
faith,” said the bishop.</p>

<p>“A week from to-day,” said the hag, “there will be seven
vultures dead at the door of our house in the wood. Give
orders to bury them in the quarry that is between the wood
and Ballyglas; that is all I am asking of you.”</p>

<p>“I shall do that if I am alive,” said the bishop. Then
she left him, and he was not sorry she to go from him.</p>

<p>A week after that day, the bishop came to Loch Glynn,
and the day after he took men with him and went to the
hags’ house in the wood of Driminuch.</p>

<p>The big black dog was at the door, and when he saw
the bishop he began running and never stopped until he
went into the lake.</p>

<p>He saw the seven vultures dead at the door, and he said
to the men: “Take them with you and follow me.”</p>

<p>They took up the vultures and followed him to the
brink of the quarry. Then he said to them: “Throw
them into the quarry: There is an end to the hags of the
enchantment.”</p>

<p>As soon as the men threw them down to the bottom
of the quarry, there rose from it seven swans as white as
snow, and flew out of their sight. It was the opinion of
the bishop and of every person who heard the story that it
was up to heaven they flew, and that the big black dog
went to the castle under the lake.</p>

<p>At any rate, nobody saw the hags of the long tooth or
the big black dog from that out, any more.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_XIII">WILLIAM OF THE TREE.</h2>

<p>In the time long ago there was a king in Erin. He was
married to a beautiful queen, and they had but one only
daughter. The queen was struck with sickness, and she
knew that she would not be long alive. She put the king
under <i>gassa</i> (mystical injunctions) that he should not
marry again until the grass should be a foot high over her
tomb. The daughter was cunning, and she used to go out
every night with a scissors, and she used to cut the grass
down to the ground.</p>

<p>The king had a great desire to have another wife, and
he did not know why the grass was not growing over the
grave of the queen. He said to himself: “There is somebody
deceiving me.”</p>

<p>That night he went to the churchyard, and he saw the
daughter cutting the grass that was on the grave. There
came great anger on him then, and he said: “I will marry
the first woman I see, let she be old or young.” When
he went out on the road he saw an old hag. He brought
her home and married her, as he would not break his
word.</p>

<p>After marrying her, the daughter of the king was under
bitter misery at (the hands of) the hag, and the hag put
her under an oath not to tell anything at all to the king,
and not to tell to any person anything she should see
being done, except only to three who were never baptised.</p>

<p>The next morning on the morrow, the king went out
a hunting, and when he was gone, the hag killed a fine
hound the king had. When the king came home he
asked the old hag “who killed my hound?”</p>

<p>“Your daughter killed it,” says the old woman.</p>

<p>“Why did you kill my hound?” said the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not kill your hound,” says the daughter, “and
I cannot tell you who killed him.”</p>

<p>“I will make you tell me,” says the king.</p>

<p>He took the daughter with him to a great wood, and he
hanged her on a tree, and then he cut off the two hands
and the two feet off her, and left her in a state of death.
When he was going out of the wood there went a thorn
into his foot, and the daughter said: “That you may never
get better until I have hands and feet to cure you.”</p>

<p>The king went home, and there grew a tree out of his
foot, and it was necessary for him to open the window, to
let the top of the tree out.</p>

<p>There was a gentleman going by near the wood, and
he heard the king’s daughter a-screeching. He went to
the tree, and when he saw the state she was in, he took
pity on her, brought her home, and when she got better,
married her.</p>

<p>At the end of three quarters (of a year), the king’s
daughter had three sons at one birth, and when they were
born, Granya Öi came and put hands and feet on the
king’s daughter, and told her, “Don’t let your children be
baptised until they are able to walk. There is a tree
growing out of your father’s foot; it was cut often, but
it grows again, and it is with you lies his healing. You
are under an oath not to tell the things you saw your
stepmother doing to anyone but to three who were never
baptised, and God has sent you those three. When they
will be a year old bring them to your father’s house, and
tell your story before your three sons, and rub your hand
on the stump of the tree, and your father will be as well
as he was the first day.”</p>

<p>There was great wonderment on the gentleman when
he saw hands and feet on the king’s daughter. She told
him then every word that Granya Oi said to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children were a year old, the mother took
them with her, and went to the king’s house.</p>

<p>There were doctors from every place in Erin attending
on the king, but they were not able to do him any good.</p>

<p>When the daughter came in, the king did not recognise
her. She sat down, and the three sons round her, and
she told her story to them from top to bottom, and the
king was listening to her telling it. Then she left her
hand on the sole of the king’s foot and the tree fell off it.</p>

<p>The day on the morrow he hanged the old hag, and
he gave his estate to his daughter and to the gentleman.</p>

<h2 id="TALE_XIV">THE OLD CROW &amp; THE YOUNG CROW.</h2>

<p>There was an old crow teaching a young crow one day,
and he said to him, “Now my son,” says he, “listen to the
advice I’m going to give you. If you see a person coming
near you and stooping, mind yourself, and be on your
keeping; he’s stooping for a stone to throw at you.”</p>

<p>“But tell me,” says the young crow, “what should I do
if he had a stone already down in his pocket?”</p>

<p>“Musha, go ’long out of that,” says the old crow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> “you’ve
learned enough; the devil another learning I’m able to
give you.”</p>

<h2 id="WHERE_THE_STORIES_CAME_FROM">WHERE THE STORIES CAME FROM.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/deco2.jpg" width="125" height="15" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first three stories, namely, “The Tailor and the Three Beasts,” “Bran,”
and “The King of Ireland’s Son,” I took down verbatim, without the alteration
or addition of more than a word or two, from <span class="irish">Seáġan O Cuinneaġáin</span>
(John Cunningham), who lives in the village of <span class="irish">Baile-an-ṗuil</span> (Ballinphuil),
in the county of Roscommon, some half mile from Mayo. He is between
seventy and eighty years old, and is, I think, illiterate.</p>

<p>The story of “The Alp-luachra” is written down from notes made at the
time I first heard the story. It was told me by <span class="irish">Seamus o h-Airt</span> (James
Hart), a game-keeper, in the barony of Frenchpark, between sixty and seventy
years old, and illiterate. The notes were not full ones, and I had to eke them
out in writing down the story, the reciter, one of the best I ever met, having
unfortunately died in the interval.</p>

<p>The stories of “Paudyeen O’Kelly,” and of “Leeam O’Rooney’s Burial,”
I got from Mr. Lynch Blake, near Ballinrobe, county Mayo, who took the
trouble of writing them down for me in nearly phonetic Irish, for which I beg
to return him my best thanks. I do not think that these particular stories
underwent any additions at his hands while writing them down. I do not know
from whom he heard the first, and cannot now find out, as he has left the locality.
The second he told me he got from a man, eighty years old, named William
Grady, who lived near Clare-Galway, but who for the last few years has been
“carrying a bag.”</p>

<p>The long story of “Guleesh na Guss dhu,” was told by the same Shamus
O’Hart, from whom I got the “Alp-luachra,” but, as in the case of the “Alp-luachra”
story, I had only taken notes of it, and not written down the whole
as it fell from his lips. I have only met one other man since, Martin Brennan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in the barony of Frenchpark, Roscommon, who knew the same story, and he
told it to me—but in an abridged form—incident for incident up to the point
where my translation leaves off.</p>

<p>There is a great deal more in the Irish version in the <span class="irish">Leaḃar Sgeuluiġeaċta</span>,
which I did not translate, not having been able to get it from Brennan,
and having doctored it too much myself to give it as genuine folk-lore.</p>

<p>The rest of the stories in this volume are literally translated from my
<span class="irish">Leaḃar Sgeuluiġeaċta</span>. Neil O’Carree was taken down phonetically, by
Mr. Larminie, from the recitation of a South Donegal peasant.</p>

<p>The Hags of the Long Teeth come from Ballinrobe, as also William of the
Tree, the Court of Crinnawn, and the Well of D’Yerree-in-Dowan. See pages
239-240 of the L. S.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Tailor and the Three Beasts</span>.”</h3>

<p><a href="#Page_1">Page 1.</a> In another variant of this tale, which I got from one Martin
Brennan—more usually pronounced Brannan; in Irish, O’Braonáin—in Roscommon,
the thing which the tailor kills is a swallow, which flew past him.
He flung his needle at the bird, and it went through its eye and killed it. This
success excites the tailor to further deeds of prowess. In this variant occurred
also the widely-spread incident of the tailor’s tricking the giant by pretending
to squeeze water out of a stone.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2">Page 2.</a> Garraun (<span class="irish">gearrán</span>), is a common Anglicised Irish word in many
parts of Ireland. It means properly a gelding or hack-horse; but in Donegal,
strangely enough, it means a horse, and coppul <span class="irish">capáll</span>, the ordinary word
for a horse elsewhere, means there a mare. The old English seem to have
borrowed this word capal from the Irish, <i>cf.</i> Percy’s version of “Robin Hood
and Guy of Gisborne,” where the latter is thus represented—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of manye a man the bane;</div>
<div class="verse">And he was clad in his capull hyde,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Topp and tayle and mayne.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#Page_7">Page 7</a>, line 4. The modder-alla (<span class="irish">madra-allta</span>, wild dog), is properly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
wolf, not a lion; but the reciter explained it thus, “<span class="irish">madar alla, sin leó
ṁan</span>,” “modder álla, that’s a l’yone,” <i>i.e.</i>, “a lion,” which I have accordingly
translated it.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_9">Page 9</a>, line 18. The giant’s shouting at night, or at dawn of day, is a common
incident in these tales. In the story of “The Speckled Bull,” not here
given, there are three giants who each utter a shout every morning, “that
the whole country hears them.” The Irish for giant, in all these stories, is
<span class="irish">faṫaċ</span> (pronounced fahuch), while the Scotch Gaelic word is <i>famhair</i>, a word
which we have not got, but which is evidently the same as the Fomhor, or sea
pirate of Irish mythical history, in whom Professor Rhys sees a kind of water
god. The only place in Campbell’s four volumes in which the word <i>fathach</i>
occurs is in the “Lay of the Great Omadawn,” which is a distinctly Irish
piece, and of which MacLean remarks, “some of the phraseology is considered
Irish.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_11">Page 11.</a> This incident appears to be a version of that in “Jack the Giant-Killer.”
It seems quite impossible to say whether it was always told in Ireland,
or whether it may not have been borrowed from some English source.
If it does come from an English source it is probably the only thing in these
stories that does.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_13">Page 13</a>, line 6. “To take his wife off (pronounced <i>ov</i>) him again.” The
preposition “from” is not often used with take, etc., in Connacht English.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_15">Page 15</a>, line 12. These nonsense-endings are very common in Irish stories
It is remarkable that there seems little trace of them in Campbell. The only
story in his volumes which ends with a piece of nonsense is the “Slender
Grey Kerne,” and it, as I tried to show in my Preface, is Irish. It ends thus:
“I parted with them, and they gave me butter on a coal, and kail brose in a
creel, and paper shoes, and they sent me away with a cannon-ball on a highroad
of glass, till they left me sitting here.” Why such endings seem to be
stereotyped with some stories, and not used at all with others, I cannot guess.
It seems to be the same amongst Slavonic Märchen, of which perhaps one in
twenty has a nonsense-ending; but the proportion is much larger in Ireland.
Why the Highland tales, so excellent in themselves, and so closely related to
the Irish ones, have lost this distinctive feature I cannot even conjecture, but
certain it is that this is so.</p>

<p>[The incident of the king’s court being destroyed at night is in the fourteenth-fifteenth
century <i>Agallamh na Senorach</i>, where it is Finn who guards
Tara against the wizard enemies.</p>

<p>I know nothing like the way in which the hero deals with the animals he
meets, and cannot help thinking that the narrator forgot or mistold his story.
Folk-tales are, as a rule, perfectly logical and sensible if their conditions be

<h3><span class="smcap">Bran’s Colour.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_15">Page 15.</a> This stanza on Bran’s colour is given by O’Flaherty, in 1808, in
the “Gaelic Miscellany.” The first two lines correspond with those of
my shanachie, and the last two correspond <i>in sound</i>, if not in sense.
O’Flaherty gave them thus—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Speckled back over the loins,</div>
<div class="verse">Two ears scarlet, equal-red.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How the change came about is obvious. The old Irish <span class="irish">suaiṫne</span>,
“speckled,” is not understood now in Connacht; so the word <span class="irish">uaiṫne</span>,
“green,” which exactly rhymes with it, took its place. Though <span class="irish">uaiṫne</span>
generally means greenish, it evidently did not do so to the mind of my reciter,
for, pointing to a mangy-looking cub of nondescript greyish colour in a corner
of his cabin, he said, <span class="irish">sin uaiṫne</span>, “that’s the colour oonya.” The words <span class="irish">os
cionn na leirge</span>, “over the loins,” have, for the same reason—namely, that
<span class="irish">learg</span>, “a loin,” is obselete now—been changed to words of the same sound.
<span class="irish">airḋaṫ na seilge</span>, “of the colour of hunting,” <i>i.e.</i>, the colour of the deer
hunted. This, too, the reciter explained briefly by saying, <span class="irish">seilg sin fiaḋ</span>,
“hunting, that’s a deer.” From the vivid colouring of Bran it would appear
that she could have borne no resemblance whatever to the modern so-called
Irish wolf-hound, and that she must in all probability have been short-haired,
and not shaggy like them. Most of the Fenian poems contain words not in
general use. I remember an old woman reciting me two lines of one of these
old poems, and having to explain in current Irish the meaning of no less than
five words in the two lines which were</p>

<p><a href="#Page_17">Page 17</a>, line 9. Pistrogue, or pishogue, is a common Anglo-Irish word for
a charm or spell. Archbishop MacHale derived it from two words, <span class="irish">fios
siṫeóg</span>, “knowledge of fairies,” which seems hardly probable.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_19">Page 19.</a> “A fiery cloud out of her neck.” Thus, in Dr. Atkinson’s <span class="irish">Páis
Partoloin</span>, from the “Leabhar Breac,” the devil appears in the form of an
Ethiopian, and according to the Irish translator, <span class="irish">ticed lassar borb ar a
bragait ocus as a shróin amal lassair shuirun tened</span>. “There used to
come a fierce flame out of his <i>neck</i> and nose, like the flame of a furnace of
fire.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_19">Page 19.</a> According to another version of this story, the blind man was
Ossian (whose name is in Ireland usually pronounced Essheen or Ussheen)
himself, and he got Bran’s pups hung up by their teeth to the skin of a newly-killed
horse, and all the pups let go their hold except this black one, which
clung to the skin and hung out of it. Then Ossian ordered the others to be
drowned and kept this. In this other version, the coal which he throws at the
infuriated pup was <span class="irish">tuaġ no rud icéint</span>, “a hatchet or something.” There must
be some confusion in this story, since Ossian was not blind during Bran’s lifetime,
nor during the sway of the Fenians. The whole thing appears to be a
bad version of Campbell’s story, No. XXXI., Vol. II., p. 103. The story may,
however, have some relation to the incident in that marvellous tale called
“The Fort of the little Red Yeoha” (<span class="irish">Bruiġion Eoċaiḋ ḃig ḋeirg</span>), in which
we are told how Conan looked out of the fort, <span class="irish">go ḃfacaiḋ sé aon óglaċ ag
teaċt ċuige, agus cu ġearr ḋuḃ air slaḃra iarainn aige, ’na láiṁ, agus
is ionga naċ loirġeaḋ si an bruioġion re gaċ caor teine d’á g-cuirfeaḋ
si ṫar a craos agus ṫar a cúḃan-ḃeul amaċ</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, “he saw one youth coming
to him, and he having a short black hound on an iron chain in his hand,
and it is a wonder that it would not burn the fort with every ball of fire it
would shoot out of its gullet, and out of its foam-mouth.” This hound is eventually
killed by Bran, but only after Conan had taken off “the shoe of refined
silver that was on Bran’s right paw” (<span class="irish">An ḃróg airgid Aiṫ-leigṫhe to ḃí air
croiḃ ḋeis Brain</span>). Bran figures largely in Fenian literature.</p>

<p>[I believe this is the only place in which Finn’s <i>mother</i> is described as a
fawn, though in the prose sequel to the “Lay of the Black Dog” (Leab. na
Feinne, p. 91) it is stated that Bran, by glamour of the Lochlanners, is made
to slay the Fenian women and children in the seeming of deer. That Finn
enjoyed the favours of a princess bespelled as a fawn is well known; also that
Oisin’s mother was a fawn (see the reference in Arg. Tales, p. 470). The
narrator may have jumbled these stories together in his memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The slaying of Bran’s pup seems a variant of Oisin’s “Blackbird Hunt”
(<i>cf.</i> Kennedy, Fictions, 240), whilst the story, as a whole, seems to be mixed
up with that of the “Fight of Bran with the Black Dog,”of which there is a
version translated by the Rev. D. Mac Innes—“Waifs and Strays of Celtic
Tradition,” Vol. I., p. 7, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>It would seem from our text that the Black Dog was Bran’s child, so that
the fight is an animal variant of the father and son combat, as found in the
Cuchullain saga. A good version of “Finn’s Visit to Lochlann” (to be
printed in Vol. III. of “Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition”) tells how
Finn took with him Bran’s leash; and how the Lochlanners sentenced him
to be exposed in a desolate valley, where he was attacked by a savage dog
whom he tamed by showing the leash. Vol. XII. of Campbell’s “MSS. of
Gaelic Stories” contains a poem entitled, “Bran’s Colour.” This should be
compared with our text.—A.N.]</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The King of Ireland’s Son.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_19">Page 19.</a> The king of Ireland’s son. This title should properly be, “The
son of a king in Ireland” (<span class="irish">Mac riġ i n-Eirinn</span>). As this name for the prince
is rather cumbrous, I took advantage of having once heard him called the king
of Ireland’s son (<span class="irish">Mac riġ Eireann</span>), and have so given it here. In another
longer and more humorous version of this story, which I heard from Shamus
O’Hart, but which I did not take down in writing, the short green man is the
“Thin black man” (<span class="irish">fear caol duḃ</span>); the gunman is <span class="irish">guinnéar</span>, not <span class="irish">gunnaire</span>;
the ear-man is <span class="irish">cluas-le-h-éisteaċt</span>; (ear for hearing), not <span class="irish">cluasaire</span>;
and the blowman is not <span class="irish">Séidire</span>, but <span class="irish">polláire-séidte</span> (blowing nostril). This
difference is the more curious, considering that the men lived only a couple of
miles apart, and their families had lived in the same place for generations.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_27">Page 27.</a> This description of a house thatched with feathers is very common
in Irish stories. On the present occasion the house is thatched with one single
feather, so smooth that there was no projecting point or quill either above or
below the feather-roof. For another instance, see the “Well of D’yerree in
Dowan,” page 131. In a poem from “The Dialogue of the Sages,” the lady
Credé’s house is described thus:—</p>

<p><a href="#Page_27">Page 27.</a> “He drew the cooalya-coric,” <i>coolaya</i> in the text, is a misprint.
The cooalya-coric means “pole of combat.” How it was “drawn” we have
no means of knowing. It was probably a pole meant to be drawn back and
let fall upon some sounding substance. The word <span class="irish">tarraing</span>, “draw,” has,
however, in local, if not in literary use, the sense of drawing back one’s arm
to make a blow. A peasant will say, “he drew the blow at me,” or “he
drew the stick,” in English; or “<span class="irish">ṫarraing sé an buille</span>,” in Irish, by which
he means, he made the blow and struck with the stick. This may be the case
in the phrase “drawing the cooalya-coric,” which occurs so often in Irish
stories, and it may only mean, “he struck a blow with the pole of combat,”
either against something resonant, or against the door of the castle. I have come
across at least one allusion to it in the Fenian literature. In the story, called
<span class="irish">Macaoṁ mór mac riġ na h-Earpáine</span> (the great man, the king of Spain’s
son), the great man and Oscar fight all day, and when evening comes Oscar
grows faint and asks for a truce, and then takes Finn Mac Cool aside privately
and desires him to try to keep the great man awake all night, while he himself
sleeps; because he feels that if the great man, who had been already
three days and nights without rest, were to get some sleep on this night,
he himself would not be a match for him next morning. This is scarcely
agreeable to the character of Oscar, but the wiles which Finn employs to make
the great man relate to him his whole history, and so keep him from sleeping,
are very much in keeping with the shrewdness which all these stories attribute
to the Fenian king. The great man remains awake all night, sorely against
his will, telling Finn his extraordinary adventures; and whenever he tries
to stop, Finn incites him to begin again, and at last tells him not to be
afraid, because the Fenians never ask combat of any man until he
ask it of them first. At last, as the great man finished his adventures
<span class="irish">do ḃí an lá ag éiriġe agus do ġaḃar Osgar agus do ḃuail an
cuaille cóṁpaic. Do ċuala an fear mór sin agus a duḃairt, “A Finn
Ṁic Cúṁail,” ar sé, “d’ḟeallair orm,”</span> etc. <i>i.e.</i>, the day was rising, and
Oscar goes and struck (the word is not “drew” here) the pole of combat.
The great man heard that, and he said, “Oh, Finn Mac Cool, you have deceived
me,” etc. Considering that they were all inside of Finn’s palace at
Allan (co. Kildare) at this time, Oscar could hardly have struck the door.
It is more probable that the pole of combat stood outside the house, and it
seems to have been a regular institution. In Campbell’s tale of “The Rider
of Grianag,” there is mention made of a <i>slabhraidh comhrac</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> “Chain of combat,”
which answers the same purpose as the pole, only not so conveniently,
since the hero has to give it several hauls before he can “take a turn out of
it.” We find allusion to the same thing in the tale of <span class="irish">Iollan arm Dearg</span>.
Illan, the hero, comes to a castle in a solitude, and surprises a woman going to
the well, and she points out to him the chain, and says, “<span class="irish">Gaċ uair ċroiṫfeas
tu an slaḃra sin ar an mbile, do ġeoḃaiḋ tu ceud curaḋ caṫ-armaċ,
agus ni iarrfaid ort aċt an cóṁrac is áil leat, mar atá diar no triúr
no ceaṫrar, no ceud</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, “every time that you will shake yon chain (suspended)
out of the tree, you will get (call forth) a hundred champions battle-armed,
and they will only ask of thee the combat thou likest thyself, that is
(combat with) two, or three, or four, or a hundred.” Chains are continually
mentioned in Irish stories. In the “Little Fort of Allan,” a Fenian story,
we read, <span class="irish">Ann sin d’éiriġ bollsgaire go bioṫ-urlaṁ agus do ċroiṫ slaḃra
éisteaċta na bruiġne, agus d’éisteadar uile go foirtineaċ</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, “then
there arose a herald with active readiness, and they shook the fort’s chain of
listening, and they all listened attentively;” and in the tale of “Illan, the Red-armed,”
there are three chains in the palace, one of gold, one of silver, and
one of findrinny (a kind of metal, perhaps bronze), which are shaken to seat
the people at the banquet, and to secure their silence; but whoever spake after
the gold chain had been shaken did it on pain of his head.</p>

<p>[In the story of Cuchullain’s youthful feats it is related that, on his first expedition,
he came to the court of the three Mac Nechtain, and, according to
O’Curry’s Summary (“Manners and Customs,” II., p. 366), “sounded a challenge.”
The mode of this sounding is thus described by Prof. Zimmer, in his
excellent summary of the <i>Tain bo Cualgne</i> (Zeit, f. vgl., Sprachforschung,
1887, p. 448): “On the lawn before the court stood a stone pillar, around
which was a closed chain (or ring), upon which was written in Ogham, that
every knight who passed thereby was bound, upon his knightly honour, to
issue a challenge. Cuchullain took the stone pillar and threw it into a brook
hard by.” This is the nearest analogue I have been able to find to our passage
in the old Irish literature (the <i>Tain</i>, it should be mentioned, goes back
in its present form certainly to the tenth, and, probably, to the seventh
century). As many of the Fenian romances assumed a fresh and quasi-definite
shape in the twelfth-fourteenth centuries, it is natural to turn for a parallel to
the mediæval romances of chivalry. In a twelfth century French romance,
the Conte de Graal, which is in some way connected with the body of Gaelic
Märchen (whether the connection be, as I think, due to the fact that the
French poet worked up lays derived from Celtic sources, or, as Professor
Zimmer thinks, that the French romances are the origin of much in current
Gaelic folk-tales), when Perceval comes to the Castle of Maidens and enters
therein, he finds a table of brass, and hanging from it by a chain of silver, a steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
hammer. With this he strikes three blows on the table, and forces the inmates
to come to him. Had they not done so the castle would have fallen into
ruins. Other parallels from the same romances are less close; thus, when Perceval
came to the castle of his enemy, Partinal, he defies him by throwing
down his shield, which hangs up on a tree outside the castle (v. 44,400,
<i>et seq.</i>). It is well known that the recognised method of challenging in
tournaments was for the challenger to touch his adversary’s shield with the
lance. This may possibly be the origin of the “shield-clashing” challenge
which occurs several times in Conall Gulban; or, on the other hand, the
mediæval practice may be a knightly transformation of an earlier custom.
In the thirteenth century prose Perceval le Gallois, when the hero comes
to the Turning Castle and finds the door shut, he strikes such a blow with
his sword that it enters three inches deep into a marble pillar (Potvin’s edition,
p. 196). These mediæval instances do not seem sufficient to explain the
incident in our text, and I incline to think that our tale has preserved a genuine
trait of old Irish knightly life. In Kennedy’s “Jack the Master, and Jack
the Servant” (Fictions, p. 32), the hero takes hold of a “club that hangs by
the door ”and uses it as a knocker.—A.N.]</p>

<p><a href="#Page_29">Page 29.</a> They spent the night, &amp;c. This brief run resembles very much
a passage in the story of Iollan Arm-dearg, which runs, <span class="irish">do rinneadar tri
treana de ’n oiḋċe, an ċeud trian re h-ól agus re h-imirt, an dara
trian re ceól agus re h-oirfide agus re h-ealaḋan, agus an treas
trian re suan agus re sáṁ-ċodlaḋ, agus do rugadar as an oiḋċe sin</span>
<i>i.e.</i>, they made three-thirds of the night; the first third with drink and
play, the second third with music and melody and (feats of) science, and
the third third with slumber and gentle sleep, and they passed away that
night.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_33">Page 33</a>, line 28. This allusion to the horse and the docking is very obscure
and curious. The old fellow actually blushed at the absurdity of the
passage, yet he went through with it, though apparently unwillingly. He
could throw no light upon it, except to excuse himself by saying that “that
was how he heard it ever.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_37">Page 37</a>, line 4. The sword of <i>three</i> edges is curious; the third edge would
seem to mean a rounded point, for it can hardly mean triangular like a bayonet.
The sword that “never leaves the leavings of a blow behind it,” is
common in Irish literature. In that affecting story of Deirdre, Naoise requests
to have his head struck off with such a sword, one that Mananan son of Lir,
had long before given to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_47">Page 47.</a> The groundwork or motivating of this story is known to all

<h3><span class="smcap">The Alp-Luachra.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_49">Page 49.</a> This legend of the alp-luachra is widely disseminated, and I
have found traces of it in all parts of Ireland. The alp-luachra is really a newt,
not a lizard, as is generally supposed. He is the lissotriton punctatus of naturalists,
and is the only species of newt known in Ireland. The male has an
orange belly, red-tipped tail, and olive back. It is in most parts of Ireland a
rare reptile enough, and hence probably the superstitious fear with which it
is regarded, on the principle of <i>omne ignotum pro terribli</i>. This reptile goes
under a variety of names in the various counties. In speaking English the
peasantry when they do not use the Irish name, call him a “mankeeper,” a
word which has probably some reference to the superstition related in our
story. He is also called in some counties a “darklooker,” a word which is
probably, a corruption of an Irish name for him which I have heard the Kildare
people use, dochi-luachair (<span class="irish">daċuiḋ luaċra</span>), a word not found in the
dictionaries. In Waterford, again, he is called arc-luachra, and the Irish MSS.
call him arc-luachra (<span class="irish">earc-luaċra</span>). The alt-pluachra of the text is a mis-pronunciation
of the proper name, alp-luachra. In the Arran Islands they
have another name, <span class="irish">ail-ċuaċ</span>. I have frequently heard of people swallowing
one while asleep. The symptoms, they say, are that the person swells
enormously, and is afflicted with a thirst which makes him drink canfuls and
pails of water or buttermilk, or anything else he can lay his hand on. In the
south of Ireland it is believed that if something savoury is cooked on a pan, and
the person’s head held over it, the mankeeper will come out. A story very
like the one here given is related in Waterford, but of a <span class="irish">dar daol</span>, or <i>daraga
dheel</i>, as he is there called, a venomous insect, which has even more legends
attached to him than the alp-luachra. In this county, too, they say that if you
turn the alp-luachra over on its back, and lick it, it will cure burns. Keating, the
Irish historian and theologian, alludes quaintly to this reptile in his <span class="irish">Tri Biorġaoiṫe
an Bháir</span>, so finely edited in the original the other day by Dr. Atkinson.
“Since,” says Keating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> “prosperity or worldly store is the weapon of the
adversary (the devil), what a man ought to do is to spend it in killing the
adversary, that is, by bestowing it on God’s poor. The thing which we read
in Lactantius agrees with this, that if an airc-luachra were to inflict a wound on
anyone, what he ought to do is to shake a pinchful of the ashes of the airc-luachra
upon the wound, and he will be cured thereby; and so, if worldly
prosperity wounds the conscience, what you ought to do is to put a poultice
of the same prosperity to cure the wound which the covetousness by which
you have amassed it has made in your conscience, by distributing upon the
poor of God all that remains over your own necessity.” The practice which
the fourth-century Latin alludes to, is in Ireland to-day transferred to the dar-daol,
or goevius olens of the naturalists, which is always burnt as soon as
found. I have often heard people say:—“Kill a keerhogue (clock or little
beetle); burn a dar-dael.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_59">Page 59.</a> Boccuch (<span class="irish">bacaċ</span>), literally a lame man, is, or rather was, the
name of a very common class of beggars about the beginning of this century.
Many of these men were wealthy enough, and some used to go about with
horses to collect the “alms” which the people unwillingly gave them. From all
accounts they appear to have been regular black-mailers, and to have extorted
charity partly through inspiring physical and partly moral terror, for the satire,
at least of some of them, was as much dreaded as their cudgels. Here is a
curious specimen of their truculence from a song called the <span class="irish">Bacach Buidhe</span>,
now nearly forgotten:—</p>

<p>The memory of these formidable guests is nearly vanished, and the boccuch in

alt-pluachra family from their human abode is fathered upon a good many
people as well as upon the father of the present MacDermot. [Is the peasant
belief in the Alp-Luachra the originating idea of the well-known Irish
Rabelaisian 14th century tale “The Vision of McConglinny?”—A.N.]</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Weasel.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_73">Page 73.</a> The weasel, like the cat, is an animal that has many legends and
superstitions attaching to it. I remember hearing from an old shanachie, now
unfortunately dead, a long and extraordinary story about the place called
Chapelizod, a few miles from Dublin, which he said was <span class="irish">Séipeul-easóg</span>, the
“weasel’s chapel,” in Irish, but which is usually supposed to have received
its name from the Princess Iseult of Arthurian romance. The story was the
account of how the place came by this name. How he, who was a Connachtman,
and never left his native county except to reap the harvest in
England, came by this story I do not know; but I imagine it must have
been told him by some one in the neighbourhood, in whose house he spent
the night, whilst walking across the island on his way to Dublin or Drogheda
harbour. The weasel is a comical little animal, and one might very well
think it was animated with a spirit. I have been assured by an old man, and
one whom I have always found fairly veracious, that when watching for ducks
beside a river one evening a kite swooped down and seized a weasel, with
which it rose up again into the air. His brother fired, and the kite came
down, the weasel still in its claws, and unhurt. The little animal then came
up, and stood in front of the two men where they sat, and nodded and bowed
his head to them about twenty times over; “it was,” said the old man,
“thanking us he was.” The weasel is a desperate fighter, and always makes
for the throat. What, however, in Ireland is called a weazel, is really a stoat,
just as what is called a crow in Ireland is really a rook, and what is called a
crane is really a heron.</p>

<p>Cáuher-na-mart, to which Paudyeen (diminutive of Paddy) was bound,
means the “city of the beeves,” but is now called in English Westport, one
of the largest towns in Mayo. It was <i>apropos</i> of its long and desolate streets
of ruined stores, with nothing in them, that some one remarked he saw Ireland’s
characteristics there in a nutshell—“an itch after greatness and nothingness;”
a remark which was applicable enough to the squireocracy and bourgeoisie of
the last century.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_79">Page 79.</a> The “big black dog” seems a favourite shape for the evil spirit
to take. He appears three times in this volume.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_81">Page 81.</a> The little man, with his legs astride the barrel, appears to be
akin to the south of Ireland spirit, the clooricaun, a being who is not known,
at least by this name, in the north or west of the island. See Crofton Croker’s
“Haunted Cellar.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_87">Page 87.</a> “The green hill opened,” etc. The fairies are still called <span class="irish">Tuatha
de Danann</span> by the older peasantry, and all the early Irish literature agrees that
the home of the <span class="irish">Tuatha</span> was in the hills, after the Milesians had taken to themselves
the plains. Thus in the story of the “Piper and the Pooka,” in the
<span class="irish">Leabhar Sgeulaigheachta</span>, not translated here, a door opens in the hill of
Croagh Patrick, and the pair walk in and find women dancing inside. Dónal,
the name of the little piper, is now Anglicised into Daniel, except in one or two
Irish families which retain the old form still. The <i>coash-t’ya bower</i>, in which
the fairy consorts ride, means literally “the deaf coach,” perhaps from the
rumbling sound it is supposed to make, and the banshee is sometimes supposed
to ride in it. It is an omen of ill to those who meet it. It seems rather out of
place amongst the fairy population, being, as it is, a gloomy harbinger of death,
which will pass even through a crowded town. Cnoc Matha, better Magha,
the hill of the plain, is near the town of Tuam, in Galway. Finvara is the
well-known king of the fairy host of Connacht. In Lady Wilde’s “Ethna,
the Bride,” Finvara is said to have carried off a beautiful girl into his hill,
whom her lover recovers with the greatest difficulty. When he gets her
back at last, she lies on her bed for a year and a day as if dead. At the end
of that time he hears voices saying that he may recover her by unloosing
her girdle, burning it, and burying in the earth the enchanted pin that fastened
it. This was, probably, the slumber-pin which we have met so often in the
“King of Ireland’s Son.” Nuala, the name of the fairy queen, was a common
female name amongst us until the last hundred years or so. The sister of
the last O’Donnell, for whom Mac an Bhaird wrote his exquisite elegy, so
well translated by Mangan—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, woman of the piercing wail,</div>
<div class="verse">That mournest o’er yon mound of clay”—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">was Nuala. I do not think it is ever used now as a Christian name at all,
having shared the unworthy fate of many beautiful Gaelic names of women
common a hundred years ago, such as Mève, Una, Sheelah, Moreen, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Slieve Belgadaun occurs also in another story which I heard, called the Bird
of Enchantment, in which a fairy desires some one to bring a sword of light
“from the King of the Firbolg, at the foot of Slieve Belgadaun.” Nephin
is a high hill near Crossmolina, in North Mayo.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_89">Page 89.</a> Stongirya (<span class="irish">stangaire</span>), a word not given in dictionaries, means,
I think, “a mean fellow.” The dove’s hole, near the village of Cong, in the
west of the county Mayo, is a deep cavity in the ground, and when a stone
is thrown down into it you hear it rumbling and crashing from side to side of
the rocky wall, as it descends, until the sound becomes too faint to hear. It
is the very place to be connected with the marvellous.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Leeam O’Rooney’s Burial.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_95">Page 95.</a> Might not Spenser have come across some Irish legend of an
imitation man made by enchantment, which gave him the idea of Archimago’s
imitation of Una:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>I never remember meeting this easy <i>deus ex machinâ</i> for bringing about a
complication before.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_101">Page 101.</a> Leeam imprecates “the devil from me,” thus skilfully turning
a curse into a blessing, as the Irish peasantry invariably do, even when in a
passion. <i>H’onnam one d’youl</i>—“my soul <i>from</i> the devil” is an ordinary
exclamation expressive of irritation or wonderment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gulleesh.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_104">Page 104.</a> When I first heard this story I thought that the name of the hero
was <span class="irish">Goillís</span>, the pronunciation of which in English letters would be Gul-yeesh;
but I have since heard the name pronounced more distinctly, and am sure that
it is <span class="irish">Giollaois</span>, g’yulleesh, which is a corruption of the name <span class="irish">Giolla-íosa</span>,
a not uncommon Christian name amongst the seventeenth century Gaels. I
was, however, almost certain that the man (now dead) from whom I first got this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
story, pronounced the word as Gulyeesh, anent which my friend Mr. Thomas
Flannery furnished me at the time with the following interesting note:—<span class="irish">Ní
cosṁúil gur Giolla-íosa atá ’san ainm Goillís, nír ḃ’ ḟeidir “Giolla-íosa”
do ḋul i n “Goillis.” Saoilim gur b’ionann Goillís agus Goill-ġéis
no Gaill-ġéis, agus is ionann “géis” agus “eala.” Is cuiṁne liom
“Muirġéis” ’sna h-“Annalalaiḃ,” agus is iomḋa ainm duine ṫigeas o
anmannaiḃ eun ċoṁ maiṫ le ó anmannaiḃ beaṫaċ, mar ata bran, fiaċ,
lon, loinin, seaḃac, ⁊c. ’Sé Goillís na g-cor duḃ fós. Naċ aiṫne ḋuit
gur leas-ainm an eala “cos-duḃ” i mórán d’áitiḃ i n-Eirinn. Tá neiṫe
eile ’san sceul sin do ḃeir orm a ṁeas gur de na sgeultaiḃ a ḃaineas
le h-ealaiḃ no géisiḃ é. Naċ aisteaċ an ni go dtug bainṗrionnsa taiṫneaṁ
do ḃuaċaill cos-duḃ cos-salaċ leisceaṁuil mar é? Naċ ait an
niḋ fós naċ dtugṫar an leas-ainm dó arís, tar éis beagáin focal air
dtús ó sin amaċ go deireaḋ. Dearmadṫar an leas-ainm agus an fáṫ
fá ḃfuair sé é.</span> <i>i.e.</i>, “It is not likely that the name Goillis is Giolla-iosa; the
one could not be changed into the other. I think that Goillis is the same as
Goill-ghéis, or Gaill-ghéis (<i>i.e.</i>, foreign swan). Géis means swan. I remember
a name Muirgheis (sea swan) in the Annals; and there is many a man’s name
that comes from the names of birds as well as from the names of animals, such
as Bran (raven), Fiach (scald crow), Lon and Loinin (blackbird), Seabhac (falcon),
etc. Moreover, he is Goillis <i>of the black feet</i>. Do you not know that the
black-foot is a name for the swan in many parts of Ireland. There are other
things in this story which make me believe that it is of those tales which treat
of swans or géises. Is it not a strange thing that the princess should take a
liking to a dirty-footed, black-footed, lazy boy like him? Is it not curious also
that the nickname of black-foot is not given to him, after a few words at the
beginning, from that out to the end? The nickname is forgotten, and the cause
for which he got it.”</p>

<p>This is certainly curious, as Mr. Flannery observes, and is probably due to
the story being imperfectly remembered by the shanachie. In order to motivate
the black feet at all, Guleesh should be made to say that he would never wash
his feet till he made a princess fall in love with him, or something of that
nature. This was probably the case originally, but these stories must be all
greatly impaired during the last half century, since people ceased to take an
interest in things Irish.</p>

<p>There are two stories in Lady Wilde’s book that somewhat resemble this.
“The Midnight Ride,” a short story of four pages, in which the hero frightens
the Pope by pretending to set his palace on fire; but the story ends thus, as
do many of Crofton Croker’s—“And from that hour to this his wife believed
that he dreamt the whole story as he lay under the hayrick on his way home
from a carouse with the boys.” I take this, however, to be the sarcastic nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
century touch of an over-refined collector, for in all my experience I
never knew a shanachie attribute the adventures of his hero to a dream. The
other tale is called the “Stolen Bride,” and is a story about the “kern of
Querin,” who saves a bride from the fairies on November Eve, but she will
neither speak nor taste food. That day year he hears the fairies say that the
way to cure her is to make her eat food off her father’s table-cloth. She does
this, and is cured. The trick which Gulleesh plays upon the Pope reminds us
of the fifteenth century story of Dr. Faustus and his dealings with his Holiness.</p>

<p>[Cf. also the story of Michael Scott’s journey to Rome, “Waifs and Strays
of Celtic Tradition,” Vol. I., p. 46. The disrespectful way in which the Pope
is spoken of in these tales does not seem due to Protestantism, as is the case
with the Faustus story, although, as I have pointed out, there are some curious
points of contact between Michael Scott and Faustus. Guleesh seems to be
an early Nationalist who thought more of his village and friend than of the
head of his religion.—A.N.]</p>

<p>The description of the wedding is something like that in Crofton Croker’s
“Master and Man,” only the scene in that story is laid at home.</p>

<p>The story of Gulleesh appears to be a very rare one. I have never been
able to find a trace of it outside the locality (near where the counties of Sligo,
Mayo, and Roscommon meet) in which I first heard it.</p>

<p>[It thus seems to be a very late working-up of certain old incidents with
additions of new and incongruous ones.—A.N.]</p>

<p><a href="#Page_112">Page 112.</a> “The rose and the lily were fighting together in her face.” This
is a very common expression of the Irish bards. In one of Carolan’s unpublished
poems he says of Bridget Cruise, with whom he was in love in his
youth:—“In her countenance there is the lily, the whitest and the brightest—a
combat of the world—madly wrestling with the rose. Behold the conflict of
the pair; the goal—the rose will not lose it of her will; victory—the lily
cannot gain it; oh, God! is it not a hard struggle!” etc.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_115">Page 115.</a> “I call and cross (or consecrate) you to myself,” says Gulleesh.
This is a phrase in constant use with Irish speakers, and proceeds from an
underlying idea that certain phenomena are caused by fairy agency. If a child
falls, if a cow kicks when being milked, if an animal is restless, I have often
heard a woman cry, <span class="irish">goirim a’s castraicim ṫu</span>, “I call and cross you,” often
abbreviated into <span class="irish">goirim, goirim</span>, merely, <i>i.e.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> “I call, I call.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Well of D’Yerree-in-Dowan.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_129">Page 129.</a> There are two other versions of this story, one a rather evaporated
one, filtered through English, told by Kennedy, in which the Dall Glic
is a wise old hermit; and another, and much better one, by Curtin. The Dall
Glic, wise blind man, figures in several stories which I have got, as the king’s
counsellor. I do not remember ever meeting him in our literature. Bwee-sownee,
the name of the king’s castle, is, I think, a place in Mayo, and
probably would be better written <span class="irish">Buiḋe-ṫaṁnaiġ</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_131">Page 131.</a> This beautiful lady in red silk, who thus appears to the prince,
and who comes again to him at the end of the story, is a curious creation of
folk fancy. She may personify good fortune. There is nothing about her in
the two parallel stories from Curtin and Kennedy.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_133">Page 133.</a> This “tight-loop” (<span class="irish">lúb teann</span>) can hardly be a bow, since the
ordinary word for that is <i>bógha</i>; but it may, perhaps, be a name for a
cross-bow.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_136">Page 136.</a> The story is thus invested with a moral, for it is the prince’s piety
in giving what was asked of him in the honour of God which enabled the queen
to find him out, and eventually marry him.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_137">Page 137.</a> In the story of <span class="irish">Cailleaċ na fiacaile fada</span>, in my <span class="irish">Leabhar
Sgeuluigheachta</span>, not translated in this book, an old hag makes a boat out
of a thimble, which she throws into the water, as the handsome lady does here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_141">Page 141.</a> This incident of the ladder is not in Curtin’s story, which makes
the brothers mount the queen’s horse and get thrown. There is a very curious
account of a similar ladder in the story of the “Slender Grey Kerne,” of which
I possess a good MS., made by a northern scribe in 1763. The passage is of
interest, because it represents a trick something almost identical with which
I have heard Colonel Olcott, the celebrated American theosophist lecturer,
say he saw Indian jugglers frequently performing. Colonel Olcott, who came
over to examine Irish fairy lore in the light of theosophic science, was of
opinion that these men could bring a person under their power so as to make him
imagine that he saw whatever the juggler wished him to see. He especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
mentioned this incident of making people see a man going up a ladder. The
MS., of which I may as well give the original, runs thus:—</p>

<p><span class="irish">Iar sin ṫug an ceiṫearnaċ mála amaċ ó na asgoill, agus ṫug ceirtle
ṡíoda amaċ as a ṁála, agus do ṫeilg suas i ḃfriṫing na fiormamuinte

arm-pit and he brought out a ball of silk from the bag, and he threw it up into
the expanse(?) of the firmament, and it became a ladder; and again he took
out a hare and let it up the ladder. Again he took out a red-eared hound and
let it up after the hare. Again he took out a timid frisking dog, and he let her
up after the hare and the hound, and said, “I am afraid,” said he, “the
hound and the dog will eat the hare, and I think I ought to send some relief
to the hare.” Then he took out of the bag a handsome youth in excellent
apparel, and he let him up after the hare and the hound and the dog. He
took out of the bag a lovely girl in beautiful attire, and he let her up after the
hare, the hound, the youth, and the dog.</p>

<p>“It’s badly it happened to me now,” says the kerne, “for the youth is
going kissing my woman, and the dog gnawing the hare.” The kerne drew
down the ladder again and he found the youth “going along with the woman,
and the dog gnawing the hare,” as he said.</p>

<p>The English “Jack and the Beanstalk” is about the best-known ladder
story.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_141">Page 141.</a> This story was not invented to explain the existence of the
twelve tribes of Galway, as the absence of any allusion to them in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
parallel versions proves; but the application of it to them is evidently the brilliant
afterthought of some Galwegian shanachie.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Court of Crinnawn.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_142">Page 142.</a> The court of Crinnawn is an old ruin on the river Lung, which
divides the counties of Roscommon and Mayo, about a couple of miles from
the town of Ballaghadereen. I believe, despite the story, that it was built by
one of the Dillon family, and not so long ago either. There is an Irish prophecy
extant in these parts about the various great houses in Roscommon.
Clonalis, the seat of the O’Connor Donn—or Don, as they perversely insist on
spelling it; Dungar, the seat of the De Freynes; Loughlinn, of the Dillons,
etc.; and amongst other verses, there is one which prophecies that “no roof
shall rise on Crinnawn,” which the people say was fulfilled, the place having
never been inhabited or even roofed. In the face of this, how the story of
Crinnawn, son of Belore, sprang into being is to me quite incomprehensible, and
I confess I have been unable to discover any trace of this particular story on
the Roscommon side of the river, nor do I know from what source the shanachie,
Mr. Lynch Blake, from whom I got it, become possessed of it. Balor of
the evil eye, who figures in the tale of “The Children of Tuireann,” was not
Irish at all, but a “Fomorian.” The <i>pattern</i>, accompanied with such funest
results for Mary Kerrigan, is a festival held in honour of the <i>patron</i> saint.
These patterns were common in many places half a century ago, and were
great scenes of revelry and amusement, and often, too, of hard fighting. But
these have been of late years stamped out, like everything else distinctively
Irish and lively.</p>

<p>[This story is a curious mixture of common peasant belief about haunted
raths and houses, with mythical matter probably derived from books. Balor
appears in the well-known tale of MacKineely, taken down by O’Donovan, in
1855, from Shane O’Dugan of Tory Island (Annals. I. 18, and cf. Rhys, Hibbert
Lect., p. 314), but I doubt whether in either case the appearance of the name
testifies to a genuine folk-belief in this mythological personage, one of the
principal representatives of the powers of darkness in the Irish god-saga.—A.N.]</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Neil O’Carree.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_148">Page 148.</a> The abrupt beginning of this story is no less curious than the short,
jerky sentences in which it is continued. Mr. Larminie, who took down this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
story phonetically, and word for word, from a native of Glencolumkille, in
Donegal, informed me that all the other stories of the same narrator were
characterized by the same extraordinary style. I certainly have met nothing
like it among any of my shanachies. The <i>crumskeen</i> and <i>galskeen</i> which Neil
orders the smith to make for him, are instruments of which I never met or
heard mention elsewhere. According to their etymology they appear to mean
“stooping-knife” and “bright-knife,” and were, probably, at one time, well-known
names of Irish surgical instruments, of which no trace exists, unless it
be in some of the mouldering and dust-covered medical MSS. from which Irish
practitioners at one time drew their knowledge. The name of the hero, if
written phonetically, would be more like Nee-al O Corrwy than Neil O Carree,
but it is always difficult to convey Gaelic sounds in English letters. When
Neil takes up the head out of the skillet (a good old Shaksperian word, by-the-by,
old French, <i>escuellette</i>, in use all over Ireland, and adopted into Gaelic), it
falls in a <i>gliggar</i> or <i>gluggar</i>. This Gaelic word is onomatopeic, and largely
in vogue with the English-speaking population. Anything rattling or gurgling,
like water in an india-rubber ball, makes a <i>gligger</i>; hence, an egg that is no
longer fresh is called a glugger, because it makes a noise when shaken. I
came upon this word the other day, raised proudly aloft from its provincial
obscurity, in O’Donovan Rossa’s paper, the <i>United Irishman</i>, every copy of
which is headed with this weighty <i>spruch</i>, indicative of his political faith:</p>

<p>“As soon will a goose sitting upon a glugger hatch goslings, as an Irishman,
sitting in an English Parliament, will hatch an Irish Parliament.”</p>

<p>This story is motivated like “The King of Ireland’s Son.” It is one of
the many tales based upon an act of compassion shown to the dead.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Trunk-Without-Head.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_157">Page 157.</a> This description of the decapitated ghost sitting astride the
beer-barrel, reminds one of Crofton Croker’s “Clooricaun,” and of the hag’s
son in the story of “Paudyeen O’Kelly and the Weasel.” In Scotch Highland
tradition, there is a “trunk-without-head,” who infested a certain ford, and
killed people who attempted to pass that way; he is not the subject, however,
of any regular story.</p>

<p>In a variant of this tale the hero’s name is Labhras (Laurence) and the
castle where the ghost appeared is called Baile-an-bhroin (Ballinvrone). It is
also mentioned, that when the ghost appeared in court, he came in streaming
with blood, as he was the day he was killed, and that the butler, on seeing him,
fainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>It is Donal’s courage which saves him from the ghost, just as happens in
another story which I got, and which is a close Gaelic parallel to Grimm’s
“Man who went out to learn to shake with fear.” The ghost whom the hero
lays explains that he had been for thirty years waiting to meet some one who
would not be afraid of him. There is an evident moral in this.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Hags of the Long Teeth.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_162">Page 162.</a> Long teeth are a favourite adjunct to horrible personalities in
folk-fancy. There is in my “Leabhar Sgeuluigheachta,” another story of a
hag of the long tooth; and in a story I got in Connacht, called the “Speckled
Bull,” there is a giant whose teeth are long enough to make a walking-staff
for him, and who invites the hero to come to him “until I draw you under
my long, cold teeth.”</p>

<p>Loughlinn is a little village a few miles to the north-west of Castlerea, in
the county Roscommon, not far from Mayo; and Drimnagh wood is a thick
plantation close by. Ballyglas is the adjoining townland. There are two of
the same name, upper and lower, and I do not know to which the story refers.</p>

<p>[In this very curious tale a family tradition seems to have got mixed up with
the common belief about haunted raths and houses. It is not quite clear why
the daughters should be bespelled for their father’s sin. This conception could
not easily be paralleled, I believe, from folk-belief in other parts of Ireland.
I rather take it that in the original form of the story the sisters helped, or,
at all events, countenanced their father, or, perhaps, were punished because
they countenanced the brother’s parricide. The discomfiture of the priest is
curious.—A.N.]</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">William of the Tree.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Page_168">Page 168.</a> I have no idea who this Granya-Öi was. Her appearance in
this story is very mysterious, for I have never met any trace of her elsewhere.
The name appears to mean Granya the Virgin.</p>

<p>[Our story belongs to the group—the calumniated and exposed daughter
or daughter-in-law. But in a German tale, belonging to the forbidden chamber
series (Grimm’s, No. 3, Marienkind), the Virgin Mary becomes godmother
to a child, whom she takes with her into heaven, forbidding her merely
to open one particular door. The child does this, but denies it thrice. To
punish her the Virgin banishes her from heaven into a thorny wood. Once,
as she is sitting, clothed in her long hair solely, a king passes, sees her, loves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and weds her, in spite of her being dumb. When she bears her first child, the
Virgin appears, and promises to give her back her speech if she will confess
her fault; she refuses, whereupon the Virgin carries off the child. This
happens thrice, and the queen, accused of devouring her children, is condemned
to be burnt. She repents, the flames are extinguished, and the Virgin
appears with the three children, whom she restores to the mother. Can there
have been any similar form of the forbidden chamber current in Ireland, and
can there have been substitution of Grainne, Finn’s wife, for the Virgin Mary,
or, <i>vice versa</i>, can the latter have taken the place of an older heathen goddess?—A.N.]</p>

provinces for “able to,” as <span class="irish">abalta air</span> (Mid Connacht); <span class="irish">inneaṁuil ċum</span>
(Waterford); <span class="irish">ionánn</span> or <span class="irish">i ndán</span>, with infinitive (West Galway); <span class="irish">’niniḃ</span> with
infinitive (Donegal).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_4">Page 4</a>, line 18, <span class="irish">ni leigeann siad dam</span> = they don’t allow me. <span class="irish">Dam</span> is
pronounced in Mid Connacht <i>dumm</i>, but <span class="irish">daṁ-sa</span> is pronounced <i>doo-sa</i>. Dr.
Atkinson has clearly shown, in his fine edition of Keating’s “Three Shafts of
Death,” that the “enclitic” form of the present tense, ending in <span class="irish">(e)ann</span>,
should only be used in the singular. This was stringently observed a couple
of hundred years ago, but now the rule seems to be no longer in force. One
reason why the form of the present tense, which ends in <span class="irish">(e)ann</span>, has been substituted
for the old present tense, in other words, why people say <span class="irish">buaileann
sé</span>, “he strikes,” instead of the correct <span class="irish">buailiḋ sé</span>, is, I think, though Dr. Atkinson
has not mentioned it, obvious to an Irish speaker. The change probably
began at the same time that the <span class="irish">f</span> in the future of regular verbs became
quiescent, as it is now, I may say, all over Ireland. Anyone who uses the
form <span class="irish">buailiḋ sé</span> would now be understood to say, “he will strike,” not “he
strikes,” for <span class="irish">buailfiḋ sé</span>, “he will strike,” is now pronounced, in Connacht,
at least, and I think elsewhere, <span class="irish">buailiḋ sé</span>. Some plain differentiation
between the forms of the tenses was wanted, and this is probably the
reason why the enclitic form in <span class="irish">(e)ann</span> has usurped the place of the old
independent present, and is now used as an independent present itself. Line
30, <span class="irish">madra</span> or <span class="irish">madaḋ alla</span> = a wolf. <span class="irish">Cuir forán air</span> = salute him—a
word common in Connacht and the Scotch Highlands, but not understood in
the South. Line 34. <span class="irish">Ḃeiḋeaḋ sé</span> = he would be, is pronounced in Connacht
as a monosyllable, like <span class="irish">ḃeiṫ</span> (<i>veh</i> or <i>vugh</i>).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_6">Page 6</a>, line 8, <span class="irish">earball</span>, is pronounced <i>rubbal</i> not <i>arball</i>, in Connacht. <span class="irish">Ni</span>
and <span class="irish">níor</span> are both used before <span class="irish">ṫáinig</span> at the present day.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_8">Page 8</a>, line 18. <span class="irish">Go marḃfaḋ sé</span> = that he would kill; another and commoner
form is, <span class="irish">go maróċaḋ sé</span>, from <span class="irish">marḃuiġ</span>, the <span class="irish">ḃ</span> being quiescent in conversation.
Line 31, <span class="irish">aḃruiṫ</span> = broth, pronounced <span class="irish">anṫruiṫ</span> (<i>anhree</i>), the <span class="irish">ḃ</span>
having the sound of an <i>h</i> only.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_12">Page 12</a>, line 27. <span class="irish">An ċuma iraiḃsó</span> is more used, and is better. <span class="irish">Sin
é an ċuma a ḃí sé</span> = “That’s the way he was.” It will be observed that
this <span class="irish">a</span> before the past tense of a verb is only, as Dr. Atkinson remarks,
a corruption of <span class="irish">do</span>, which is the sign of the past tense. The <span class="irish">do</span> is hardly
ever used now, except as contracted into <span class="irish">d’</span> before a vowel, and this is a
misfortune, because there is nothing more feeble or more tending to disintegrate
the language than the constant use of this colourless vowel <span class="irish">a</span>. In these
folk stories, however, I have kept the language as I found it. This <span class="irish">a</span> has
already made much havoc in Scotch Gaelic, inserting itself into places where it
means nothing. Thus, they say <i>tha’s again air a sin: Dinner a b fhearr na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sin, etc.</i> Even the preposition <span class="irish">de</span> has with some people degenerated into this
<span class="irish">a</span>, thus <span class="irish">ta sé a ḋiṫ orm</span>, “I want it,” for <span class="irish">de ḋiṫ</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_14">Page 14</a>, line 9. For <span class="irish">air</span> read <span class="irish">uirri</span>. Line 12. <span class="irish">seilg</span> means hunting, but the
reciter said, <span class="irish">seilg, sin fiaḋ</span>, “Shellig, that’s a deer,” and thought that Bran’s
back was the same colour as a deer’s. <span class="irish">Uaine</span>, which usually means green, he
explained by turning to a mangy-looking cur of a dull nondescript colour, and
saying <span class="irish">ta an madaḋ sin uaine</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_16">Page 16</a>, line 30. <span class="irish">Bearna</span> and <span class="irish">teanga</span>, and some other substantives of the
same kind are losing, or have lost, their inflections throughout Connacht.
Line 31. <span class="irish">tiġeaċt</span> is used just as frequently and in the same breath as <span class="irish">teaċt</span>,
without any difference of meaning. It is also spelt <span class="irish">tuiḋeaċt</span>, but in Mid-Connacht
the <span class="irish">t</span> is slender, that is <span class="irish">tiġeaċt</span> has the sound of <i>t’yee-ught</i>, not
<i>tee-ught</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Atkinson has shown that it is incorrect to decline <span class="irish">teanga</span> as an <i>-n</i>
stem: correct genitive is <span class="irish">teangaḋ</span>. <span class="irish">Rearta</span>: see <span class="irish">rasta</span> in O’Reilly. Used
in Arran thus: <span class="irish">Ní’l sé in rasta duit</span> = you cannot venture to.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_18">Page 18</a>, line 15. <span class="irish">Gual</span> means a coal; it must be here a corruption of some
other word. <span class="irish">Muid</span> is frequently used for <span class="irish">sinn</span>, “we,” both in Nom. and Acc.
all over Connacht, but especially in the West.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_20">Page 20</a>, line 3. <span class="irish">Deimuġ</span> (d’yemmo͡o). This word puzzled me for a long
time until I met this verse in a song of Carolan’s</p>

<span class="irish">buaiḋ</span> “victory.” <span class="irish">Deimuġ</span> or <span class="irish">diomuġ</span> must be a slightly corrupt pronunciation
of <span class="irish">díombuaiḋ</span>, and the meaning is, that the king’s son put himself under
a wish that he might suffer defeat during the year, if he ate more than two
meals at one table, etc. Line 15. <span class="irish">reasta</span> = a “writ,” a word not in the
dictionaries—perhaps, from the English, “arrest.” <span class="irish">Cúig ṗúnta</span>. The numerals
<span class="irish">tri ceiṫre cúig</span> and <span class="irish">sé</span> seem in Connacht to aspirate as often as not, and

often is. Mr. Charles Bushe, B.L., tells me he has tested this rule over and
over again in West Mayo, and has found it invariable.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_26">Page 26</a>, line 18. <span class="irish">I dteaċ an ḟaṫaiġ</span> = In the giant’s house. <span class="irish">Tiġ</span>, the

here it means the head of the bed. <span class="irish">Air colḃa</span> means, on the outside

<p><a href="#Page_52">Page 52</a>, line 15. “<span class="irish">Súf</span>!” a common expression of disgust in central Connacht,
both in Irish and in English. Line 18. <span class="irish">Uile ḋuine</span>. This word <span class="irish">uile</span> is
pronounced <i>hulla</i> in central Connacht, and it probably gets this <i>h</i> sound from
the final <span class="irish">ċ</span> of <span class="irish">gaċ</span>, which used to be always put before it. Father Eugene
O’Growney tells me that the guttural sound of this <span class="irish">ċ</span> is still heard before <span class="irish">uile</span>
in the Western islands, and would prefer to write the word <span class="irish">’ċ uile</span>. When
<span class="irish">uile</span> follows the noun, as <span class="irish">na daoine uile</span>, “all the people,” it has the sound
of <i>ellik</i> or <i>ellig</i>, probably from the original phrase being <span class="irish">uile go léir</span>, contracted
into <span class="irish">uileg</span>, or even, as in West Galway, into <span class="irish">’lig</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_54">Page 54</a>, line 9. <span class="irish">Goile</span> = “appetite,” properly “stomach.” Line 30. <span class="irish">An
ṫrioblóid</span> = the trouble, but better written <span class="irish">an trioblóid</span>, since feminine
nouns, whose first letter is <span class="irish">d</span> or <span class="irish">t</span>, are seldom aspirated after the article.
There is even a tendency to omit the aspiration from adjectives beginning with
the letters <span class="irish">d</span> and <span class="irish">t</span>. Compare the celebrated song of <span class="irish">Bean duḃ an ġleanna</span>,

<p>This would have made her point just as well. Unfortunately, Lady
Wilde is always equally extraordinary or unhappy in her informants
where Irish is concerned. Thus, she informs us that <i>bo-banna</i> (meant
for <i>bo-bainne</i>, a milch cow) is a “white cow”; that tobar-na-bo (the
cow’s well) is “the well of the white cow”; that Banshee comes
from <i>van</i> “the woman”—(<i>bean</i> means “a woman”); that Leith
Brogan—<i>i.e.</i>, leprechaun—is “the artificer of the brogue,” while it
really means the half or one-shoe, or, according to Stokes, is merely a
corruption of locharpan; that tobar-na-dara (probably the “oak-well”) is
the “well of tears,” etc. Unfortunately, in Ireland it is no disgrace, but
really seems rather a recommendation, to be ignorant of Irish, even when
writing on Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Thus he over and over again speaks of a slumber-pin as <i>bar an suan</i>,
evidently mistaking the <i>an</i> of <i>bioran</i>, “a pin,” for <i>an</i> the definite article. So
he has <i>slat an draoiachta</i> for <i>slaitin</i>, or <i>statán draoigheachta</i>. He says <i>innis
caol</i> (narrow island) means “light island,” and that <i>gil an og</i> means “water of
youth!” &amp;c.; but, strangest of all, he talks in one of his stories of killing and
boiling a stork, though his social researches on Irish soil might have taught
him that that bird was not a Hibernian fowl. He evidently mistakes the very
common word <i>sturc</i>, a bullock, or large animal, or, possibly, <i>torc</i>, “a wild
boar,” for the bird stork. His interpreter probably led him astray in the best
good faith, for <i>sturck</i> is just as common a word with English-speaking people
as with Gaelic speakers, though it is not to be found in our wretched dictionaries.</p>

very numerous all over the country, until O’Connell and the Parliamentarians,
with the aid of the Catholic prelates, gained the ear and the leadership of the
nation, and by their more than indifference to things Gaelic put an end to all
that was really Irish, and taught the people to speak English, to look to London,
and to read newspapers. This particular MS. was written by one Seorsa
MacEineircineadh, whoever he was, and it is black with dirt, reeking with turf
smoke, and worn away at the corners by repeated reading. Besides this story it
contains a number of others, such as “The Rearing of Cuchulain,” “The Death
of Conlaoch,” “The King of Spain’s Son,” etc., with many Ossianic and elegiac
poems. The people used to gather in at night to hear these read, and, I am
sure, nobody who understands the contents of these MSS., and the beautiful
alliterative language of the poems, will be likely to agree with the opinion
freely expressed by most of our representative men, that it is better for the
people to read newspapers than study anything so useless.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In a third MS., however, which I have, made by a modern Clare
scribe, Domhnall Mac Consaidin, I find “the Emperor Constantine,” not
the “Emperor of Constantinople,” written. O’Curry in his “Manuscript
Materials,” p. 319, ascribes “Conall Gulban,” with some other stories, to a date
prior to the year 1000; but the fighting with the Turks (which motivates the
whole story, and which cannot be the addition of an ignorant Irish scribe, since
it is also found in the Highland traditional version), shows that its date, in its
present form, at least, is much later. There is no mention of Constantinople in
the Scotch Gaelic version, and hence it is possible—though, I think, hardly
probable—that the story had its origin in the Crusades.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It appears, unfortunately, that all classes of our Irish politicians alike
agree in their treatment of the language in which all the past of their race—until
a hundred years ago—is enshrined. The inaction of the Parliamentarians,
though perhaps dimly intelligible, appears, to me at least, both short-sighted
and contradictory, for they are attempting to create a nationality with one
hand and with the other destroying, or allowing to be destroyed, the very thing
that would best differentiate and define that nationality. It is a making of
bricks without straw. But the non-Parliamentarian Nationalists, in Ireland at
least, appear to be thoroughly in harmony with them on this point. It is
strange to find the man who most commands the respect and admiration of that
party advising the young men of Gaelic Cork, in a printed and widely-circulated
lecture entitled: “What Irishmen should know,” to this effect:—“I
begin by a sort of negative advice. You all know that much has been written
in the Irish language. This is of great importance, especially in connection
with our early history, hence must ever form an important study for scholars.
But you are, most of you, not destined to be scholars, and so I should simply
advise you—especially such of you as do not already know Irish—to leave all
this alone, or rather to be content with what you can easily find in a translated
shape in the columns of Hardiman, Miss Brooke, Mangan, and Sigerson.” So
that the man whose most earnest aspiration in life is Ireland a nation, begins by
advising the youth of Ireland <i>not</i> to study the language of their fathers, and to
read the gorgeous Gaelic poetry in such pitiful translations as Hardiman and
Miss Brooke have given of a few pieces. The result of this teaching is as
might be expected. A well-known second-hand book-seller in Dublin assured
me recently that as many as 200 Irish MSS. had passed through his hand
within the last few years. Dealers had purchased them throughout the
country in Cavan, Monaghan, and many other counties for a few pence, and
sold them to him, and he had dispersed them again to the four winds of heaven,
especially to America, Australia, and New Zealand. Many of these must have
contained matter not to be found elsewhere. All are now practically lost, and
nobody in Ireland either knows or cares. In America, however, of all countries
in the world, they appreciate the situation better, and the fifth resolution
passed at the last great Chicago Congress was one about the Irish language.</p>
